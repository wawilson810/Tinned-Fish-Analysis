Not too long ago I ventured into preparing my first official New England Clam Chowder, the one with the cream, clams, potatoes and really any fine addition like celery, red bell pepper finely chopped, and the end result was delicious. I have used the Clam Base on several occasions for dishes that require that particular infusion of clam and the results have always made me look good around the dinner table. I use most of the Seafood line but since prices have kind of skyrocketed in the last years I settle for the Clam Base for it does bring the best in Seafood dishes. I also used the Fish Base, Seafood Base (tasty for a Bisque be that of Shrimp, Lobster-I do stick to Shrimp for I do not catch my own lobsters), Crab Base, Lobster Base, Chicken, etc., but as of late for the economics I have concentrated my money spending to this Clam Base and it pays to use it. Why 5 Stars? Because 4 do not seem to convey the joy of a tasty Fish Chowder, Seafood Stew, for those great people of amazon that love all things seafood this product can only increase the pleasure. I should add that the clams I bought at my local market did not (by a long shot!) made the mark.

5,5,False,1273363200,"WILD-CAUGHT fish are free of any diseases that may pop up, even in the huge, (but not as huge as the ocean!) tanks used for farm-raised fish.  Salmon is supposed to be heart-healthy, and has far less, (if any), of the mercury found in albacore tuna.  And....salmon tastes yummy....especially sockeye salmon, (that is in these cans) -- which is reputed to be THE best-tasting salmon of all!

REDHEAD salmon, made by the PURE ALASKAN SALMON COMPANY, herein being reviewed, is very, very, Very, VERY tasty!  The ingredients are simply ""Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon and Salt"".  This is not the (much!) more expensive fileted canned salmon -- but the skin and bone content is kept to a minimum.  (Skin and bones -- which are in themselves very healthy eating -- can easily become almost unrecognizable, upon simply combining the salmon with other ingredients and mixing.)  Sodium content here is medium -- 270 miligrams per can.  The sodium helps to keep the salmon fresh, (a natural preservative, if you will), but it can easily be washed away by taking the open can, and pressing the just-removed top in, whilst you run cold water over it....

Sockeye salmon is RED salmon, (hence the name, REDHEAD).  Red salmon is slightly more fatty -- but much more tasty, (at least to me), than the pink variety of salmon.  (The extra fat gives the redder colour).
THIS brand of sockeye salmon, (REDHEAD) is amongst the tastiest sockeye salmon I have ever eaten!

This salmon comes in a nice, golden coloured can, with NO SEAMS!  Seams in cans containing any food have been known to leach toxic materials into that food -- but there is no worry of that here.  I bought my REDHEAD salmon on 9th September, 2009 -- and the expiration date reads July, 2012 -- so this salmon will stay fresh for a LONG time!  It also bears the ""OU"" symbol of the Orthodox Union -- meaning that this product meets the highest in kosher quality.

As attested to by the enclosures, (company priorities for safe, organic products, and serious stewardship of the atmosphere and planet -- plus some yummy recipes), the PURE ALASKA SALMON CO., which makes REDHEAD and other salmon, is totally committed to not only fine products -- but to the survival of their customers, (and all other human beings!), who inhabit this planet!

This is salmon caught in ALASKA.  It is made by the Pure Alaskan Salmon Company, of Burlingham, WAshington, 98225.  It is therefore a TOTALLY AMERICAN-MADE PRODUCT!  For those who care about such things, (like me!), this is VERY important -- and can even make the salmon tastier! : )

48,5,False,1386028800,"I've eaten all varieties of this salmon and went so far as to post a review of it on my personal site, so this is a repost of that review.

As I'll detail in an upcoming post (once I'm sure the dietary protocols are repeatable), I've been experimenting with Protein Sparing Modified Fasts (PSMF) in an effort to cut the most fat in the shortest amount of time possible. One of the things I really like about PSMFs are that they cut out all of the fluff, leaving you with the bare minimum you need to sustain your muscle mass and health in the interest of shortening the normally fairly extended pain window associated with dieting down. Anyhow, as part of these experiments, I needed a way to both get protein and Omega 3 I a very slim caloric window, and after reading the landmark new study on rancidity in liquid fish oil products, I needed to find a better method of getting my protein and Omega 3's than my typical Ogre Juice shakes.

The obvious answer was canned light tuna - 97% protein by weight, with the 3% that isn't protein being high quality Omega fats. However, I then read some research that indicates that tuna is heavily poisoned by mercury, so much so, in fact, that the FDA has issued an advisory on the issue. Now, the FDA's recommendations are not to eat more than 15 ounces of white tuna (.5 PPM mercury levels) per week, and light tuna typically has lower mercury levels (in the .1 PPM range). However, considering that I need to eat 15 oz of it a day (75 oz a week), I'm still in the danger zone. So I started looking into the alternatives, and it turns out that canned Alaskan salmon is an ideal replacement, as it has only slightly higher caloric content, but considerably more Omega oils, and no major contaminants. It was in researching salmon that I came across Pure Alaska Salmon Co., a family owned company that catches, cans, and sells premium Alaskan salmon.

While looking through their site, I happened to notice that something was amiss with the layout. I sent them an email informing them of the problem, just trying to be a nice guy, but I jokingly mentioned that they could `repay me in salmon' if they so chose. Well, turns out they did, and a few days later, a nice package with a hand-written thank you note arrived at my door:

They sent me a box with seven assorted cans of salmon, and I liked it so much, I thought I'd give it a review.

First, they sent me four varieties of salmon:
Sockeye salmon fillets
Sockeye salmon with edible skin and bones
Pink salmon fillets
Pink salmon with edible skin and bones

First up, I tried the sockeye (redhead) salmon, and flavor-wise, this is the best of the bunch. The taste is very subtle, but it's warm and smooth, not salty or sharp at all, and it has that wonderful, distinctive salmon flavor without any fishy aftertaste. Between the fillet and traditional, I prefer traditional, as the edible skin provides a very tasty fatty flavor over the top. However, I'm not a huge fan of the bones, though they are more like cartilage (very easy to chew up, and probably loaded with calcium).

Unfortunately, the redhead has significantly higher quantities of fat (roughly 5 times more at ~5g per serving) and less protein, so I won't be able to eat it on my PSMF. The pink salmon, however, has a wonderful nutritional profile, and though it doesn't taste quite as good as the redhead, it is still heads and tails above tuna.

Just so I had something besides tuna to compare it to, I bought a can of Bumblebee Alaskan salmon and A/B tested between it and the Think Pink pink salmon. The Bumblebee is obviously highly salted, so much so that `salt' is probably the primary flavor. In contrast, the think pink has a very mellow flavor (though not quite as mellow as redhead), with only a hint of saltiness. I vastly prefer the Pure Alaska Salmon to Bumblebee, though I suspect Bumblebee would be fine for a recipe where the salmon flavor is more or less drowned out by the other competing flavors. For me, however, I have already ordered another two dozen cans (roughly $86 with shipping, or $3.58 per can) for my next PSMF week.

If you have any interest in canned salmon, I heartily recommend these guys, looks like a great little company and they put out very high quality food.

One additional statement I will make, that wasn't in the original review: I have now purchased and eaten over 100 cans of the salmon fillets in the last six months, which is an enormous testament to the quality of it.",Great Alternative to Tuna and High-Quality Bodybuilding Food!,B0006UFY46,Salmon,"Redhead Wild Sockeye Salmon From Alaska, (12) 7.5 Oz.

76,5,False,1357776000,"Anchovies are common ingredients in Mediterranean dishes, but are especially valued in Spanish cuisine. Ortiz is a Spanish company that I have come to trust for quality, and fortunately can purchase these locally for a fraction of the price and no insane shipping costs. Still, I am so sold on this brand and product that I would probably be coerced in paying whatever I had to to get them.

What sets these apart from the slimy, salt laden anchovies that wind up on pizzas is they are packed in oil. The cheaper anchovies that send a lot of people running are packed in salt and are way too salty (and, frankly, gross in my opinion).  These, on the other hand, are mild in flavor, slightly salty, and have a wonderful texture.

It is this grade of anchovy that I use in Caesar salads, and use as a base for dishes like spaghetti con aglio e olio (spaghetti with garlic and oil) and other dishes. It is also an essential ingredient in my spaghetti alla puttanesca recipe. Indeed, since in that dish I use expensive San Marzano tomatoes, and the highest quality capers (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Non-Pareil-Wild-Capers/dp/B004T345GO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Non-Pareil Wild Capers</a>), along with garlic and a quality olive oil, it does not make sense to use anything but high quality anchovies like these.

As I said, these are not overly salty and not at all slimy compared to some of the cheaper brands and all that are packed in salt instead of oil. The flavor is totally different from those that you find on pizza. But what I really love about these is the fact that they are packed in a jar instead of a can. Since I use them for bases and in moderation in the dishes mentioned above, a small amount goes a long way. When I was buying them in cans I would toss the unused ones - often half a can - but here I can take a few strips and reseal the jar and refrigerate it. These are good for about six months after opening, so you will not be wasting high quality filets that you may not use up in a recipe.

I am not sure how this is done - perhaps by shortening the time the fish is cured in salt?
The price is unjustifiably high though - one can get 2 lbs of Moroccan anchovies for the same price.
Nevertheless, these are (from far) the best anchovies I tried.

UPDATE: I can't say any longer that these are the best anchovies; they are still among best, but I found anchovies made in L'Escala (in Spain) that are just as good, yet different than Ortiz.

175,5,False,1167609600,"Starkist Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water makes for one of the healthiest foods on your grocer's shelf. At the Amazon price it is economical, too. More importantly, however, this tuna provides you with protein, B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 is just about the only fatty acid that is actually good for your heart. Your heart loves omega-3; trust me!

Starkist packs the tuna in water to keep it moist and fresh for months at a time while it is in the can before you open it. You may want to drain the water from the can before you remove the tuna. This tuna, as Amazon correctly notes, comes from only the choicest cuts of the fish and it tastes delicious. While you certainly can eat it right out of the can; it mixes particularly well with products like mayonnaise and reduced fat mayonnaise.

One caveat, however: the water/vegetable broth contains soy, salt, and pyrophosphate. If you are allergic to any of these ingredients or if you are on a salt free diet consult your doctor before eating this tuna. Starkist may make this tuna with reduced salt; and there are other brands of tuna that definitely contain less salt.

Overall, Starkist solid white albacore tuna in water offers an amazingly healthy meal. It is especially healthy for you because it is lower in fat and cholesterol than meat or even poultry. It tastes great directly from the can; and it makes an excellent ingredient for tuna fish sandwiches with mayo or any recipe that requires tuna. I highly recommend this tuna for people who want to eat healthy foods; and this tuna fish will never disappoint mothers who want to feed their children well.

178,5,False,1498435200,"back at the height of the Roman Empire, fish sauce ruled, and one version of that, known as Garum, was king. It was famous for its heady aroma and deep flavoring potential. That condiment was used as we might use soy sauce - mostly found at table and put on a dish after cooking. Liquamen, on the other hand, was a variation made from whole fish, as Colatura is. That sauce was mostly used by chefs, and appears to have been the primary salty contributor to many Roman dishes. Colatura is, as you can see, beautiful stuff, and it is potent. What some call heady others will call revolting - It's a toting you either dig or you don't. That said, proper use of fish sauce dictates that you use enough to add that certain je ne sais quoi of umami to a dish - You shouldn't taste fishy, you should just sense that something not quite identifiable is contributing in a big way.

188,5,True,1404086400,"The ultimate secret ingredient!

The bottle itself is attractive and the beautiful amber color of the contents make this an attractive addition to your pantry or counter. This fish sauce is the secret ingredient in many Italian dishes, from fish to pasta. As a matter of fact it is a mainstay in many Venetian kitchens.

Anchovy sauce (Liquamen) is very salty so it is best to add it before adding salt to your dishes. Add in small amounts, tasting as you go is the best method to conserve both the sauce and to make sure you do not over season. The sauce does have a fishy smell but it is not as strong as one would think and does not have a particularly fishy flavor. It pretty much is pure umami and salt.

Since using this fish sauce in a few of my dishes I have noticed a greater appreciation of them by those who have no idea I have added it. It does add a richness of flavor to just about anything. Since people's attitude towards anything ""anchovy"" is odd I find it best to keep my secret.

If you are attempting to replicate some old Roman dishes this sauce is a decent stand in for Liquamen (often called garum)",Delicious way to add umami to your dishes,B000CRIFGM,Anchovies,"Nettuno Colatura Anchovy Sauce &ndash; Cetara, Campania, Italy - 3.3 oz",0.99748623,1

192,5,False,1374883200,"Colatura is a sauce made from the essence of anchovies. It is more refined than the fish sauces of Asia.  After you understand how it is made, you can greater appreciate what it is and why it costs what it costs.

The colaura is made in Cetara, a small town near Salerno on the Italian Amalfi coast. Only anchovies that are caught by the old method of purse seining (lampara) from about April through July, when the fish have less fat, are used. The processing is done by cleaning the anchovies by hand and then putting them in a container, sprinkled with salt, for twenty-four hours. Then several layers of anchovies are placed inside an oak or chestnut barrel cut down to a third called a terzigno, alternating with layers of salt, until the terzigno is filled. A wooden cover is placed on top and then a heavy marine stone is placed on the cover, which presses down on the contents. After a while, a liquid surfaces above the cover. It's collected and put into five-liter bottles with fresh oregano leaves, plugged up, and exposed to the summer sun. As the heat evaporates the water in it, a very concentrated liquid forms.

At the end of the summer, between October and November, the liquid is returned to the terzigno, filtering slowly through the anchovies that were left to mature in the barrel, picking up even more flavor on the way. In December, a hole is poked into the base of the barrel with a tool called a ""vriale,"" allowing the liquid to drip into special glass containers. The result is a mahogany-colored, salty liquid with great concentrated flavor.

One liter of colatura is made from about five and a half pounds of anchovies. In 2011, the entire production of colatura by the producer was only 700 liters. The entire process is by hand. Hence the price.

A typical way to use it is to mix a teaspoon of colatura with 2 tablespoons of good quality EV olive oil and some crushed garlic and maybe some fresh parsley, then add to your favorite tomato sauce, and serve with pasta (linguine, linguine fine, spaghetti), or you can just sprinkle it straight from the bottle (a little goes a long way). Restaurants in southern Italy sometimes put bottles of colatura on the table to be used as a condiment.",Artisinal Anchovy Ambrosia,B000CRIFGM,Anchovies,"Nettuno Colatura Anchovy Sauce &ndash; Cetara, Campania, Italy - 3.3 oz",0.997208,1

278,3,True,1418428800,"I'm not quite sure how to rate this product since I usually only eat sardines in tomato sauce.  Alton Brown in his Good Eats show praised the health benefits of sardines and provided a simple recipe for them with avocado over sourdough.  He specifically recommended the double-layer brisling sardines, I think because they are smaller and therefore you don't notice the bones.  As somebody who absolutely hates the sandy texture of sardine bones, that's one huge plus for this product.  I couldn't feel any bones whatsoever.

But taste-wise, well that's where my dilemma comes in.  I love tuna fish and would eat that every day if not for the mercury risk.  That's why I turned to sardines. I also love fishy-tasting fish.  Something I noticed about the American food culture is that the fish with the most wide appeal are the ones that have the blandest flavor.  I love the ones that really taste fishy (anchovies, yum!).

So I was really surprised just how much I hated these sardines.  And the only reason I can think of is that they taste too fishy.  But it's not a good fishy to me.  It actually makes me want to gag a bit. I'm not sure if my problem is more with the sardines or with the smoked flavor.  I wish I hadn't bought a whole case of these on the assumption I would like them. The oil makes it even worse.  I find it a slight improvement if I rinse the oil off.

I was sooooo scared to eat these things that I let the first sample box (from the health food store) sit in my cupboard for over a month before I worked up the courage to try a bite.  I actually think I started with the regular old sardines in olive oil.  The more bites I took, the more I liked them. Then I got brave and bought a box of these (with mustard) from the store.  Wow, even better.  They tasted so good, I went ahead and ordered the 12-pack on amazon.  I have also tried the other mustard sardines by crown prince (not sure what the difference is) and they are not as good.  Since my crazy diet ended (well..I'm still gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free..slightly crazy!) I've had these things on toast (gluten free) with tomatoes - mmmm..., with rice, and in a salad.

I definately wouldn't spend $14.00 or more on sardines, even if it's a twelve pack.  I take advantage of Crown Prince's coupon deal where they send me coupons after I send them proof of purchase labels.  The sardines only cost me 1 or 2 cents a can after using the coupons.

Indeed Sardines are among the healthiest of foods.  Sardines contain more Omega-3 fatty acids than any other fish.  Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatories and inflammation is the root cause of many diseases (if not all).  One of the things I've noticed over the years after eating sardines regularly is a drammatic reduction in headaches.  Before I ate sardines regularly, I used to get tension headaches quite often.  Since I began eating sardines regularly, it has been years since I've had a single headache.

Whenever I buy the varieties which have salt added, I put the sardines in a colender to wash away the excessive salt before eating them.

399,4,True,1491177600,"I bought this after being very satisfied with the ""natural"" version of Crown Prince Two Layer Brisling Sardines in the tan colored box.  I figured this product in the red box, lacking the nonspecific ""natural"" moniker, might be the same, for a few dollars cheaper by the dozen cans.  My last case of the tan box and red box tasted a bit different, but I can't say for sure if it was a batch-to-batch variation or if it was intentional by Crown Prince.  The tan box ""natural"" sardines had noticeably more smoky flavor than the red box sardines.  Both boxes claim ""naturally wood smoked"", but the sardines in the red box I bought have less smoky flavor.  Both products had delicious, small, attractive, headless sardines slathered in oil that I drained off to the best of my ability before eating.  The fish are good quality as is the BPA-free packaging.  There are about 14 sardines per can, with most of the skin and tail intact.  I slightly prefer the ones in the tan box based on flavor.  These are good quality sardines that claim to be wild-caught and sustainable.

I remember seeing Sardines packed in Soy Oil in the past wondering WHY?  I'm perfectly happy with extra virgin olive oil and I like the taste.  The ONLY reason I decided to try the soy oil product is because I assumed I might not like the other Sardines packed in spring water.  Boy, was I wrong.  I really like the taste of the sardines packed in spring water and they have 90mg Sodium vs 125mg Sodium found in these Sardines packed in soy oil.  I really don't like the taste of the soy oil sardines so it is a win-win the product that tastes best (Spring Water) is lower in sodium as well.  I don't need to compromise on taste to reduce my sodium intake.  Another bonus is I can drain the spring water can directly into the sink and not have to mess with our ""grease can"" like I do with (these) sardines packed in oil.

I prefer the taste of the sardines packed in Spring Water but these sardines in Soybean Oil are still low in sodium.  I couldn't even find a low sodium product from King Oscar.

486,4,True,1419033600,"There are sardines and then there are SARDINES.  I grew up eating sardines.  I even carried them to school in my lunch sack.  I never knew then that there was any other sardine than those that were cross packed.  Things changed over time and now it is almost impossible to find cross packed sardines.  The small cross packed sardines were ""Brisling"" which by definition are small fatty European fish; usually smoked or canned like sardines.  These fish were small enough to be packed crosswise in the can and thus the name ""cross packed"".  These Crown Prince sardines are not small enough to be a true `cross pack' they are a larger fish than the true cross pack and are arranged in the can in a ""Herring bone"" fashion and therefore a stretch on the definition for `cross pack'.  Being a little larger fish they don't have quite the rich flavor of the smaller true cross packed fishes.  The King Oscar brand up until recently was able to be found with a true cross pack with the accompanied flavor of that small fish.  But you may as well search for hen's teeth as for the King Oscar cross pack.  They seem nowhere to be found.  Maybe the fishery has brought them to extinction?  So it seems we are left with these Crown Prince sardines as the current ""best"".  On a scale of one to ten I would rate the Crown Prince as a seven whereas the King Oscar would be a ten.  This would also be the rating I would give for most all of the ""two Layer"" packing of all other brands.  Considering that some brands have HUGE fish passing as sardines which I could not even rate on a one to ten scale I find these Crown Prince cross packed sardines  to be a reasonable buy for the current state of affairs in the sardine industry.
Updated 2/2/2015.  I try to give my honest impression and therefore I'm updating this review.  I just opened another tin that came within the 12 pack I ordered and these were well packed crosswise i.e. 90 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the can.  There was a nice bath of olive oil and the fish were plump, moist and firm with a mild smokey flavor.  They were very good.  Thus my impression now is that since they are hand packed there seems to be some inconsistency.  If they came all as good as this tin I would give them 5 stars.",Good sardines but seem a little inconsistent,B000EEZ3LI,Sardines,"Crown Prince One Layer Brisling Sardines in Tomato, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0.9976948,1

497,5,True,1414713600,"I am new to sardines but I am a big fish lover and eater of herring off and on.  I was looking for a nutritious lunch item to add to my diet and after reading lots of reviews I started with the King Oscar brand.  I found it rather soft, mushy, and fishy. I even had a hard time getting the fish out of the tin as a whole piece, I heard co-workers complaining of the fishy smell and knew it wouldn't work as a lunch staple.

Remembering most of the bad reviews for the Crown Prince brand seemed to be ""too dry"", ""too smoky"" as compared to the KO brand so I decided to give it a try.  I definitely prefer ""Crown Prince Brisling Sardines Two Layer"" to the equivalent Crown Oscar offering, and at current Amazon pricing it is also over $8 cheaper.

I wouldn't call the CP fish dryer than KO,  I would say firmer you can actually get a whole fish out of the tin with out it breaking apart with chopsticks or a fork.  The flesh is firmer but not nearly dry and flavorless as some reviewers would make it out to be.

As for the smoke flavor, I found the CP brand had the flavor notes generally associated with a naturally smoked product.  I prefer this to the more acidic flavors of liquid smoke I picked up in the KO brand.  Watch the labeling on food items ""Natural Wood Smoked"" in the USA means the real deal.  Users of liquid smoke have all kinds of terminology on labels to hide the fact they are not actually smoking the product.

CP is way less smelly than KO and should help with co-worker/family interactions.

FYI, another thing I noticed in the reviews is the positives for KO were more evident prior to them being bought out by Bumble Bee.",Crown Prince quality at low price.,B000EEZ3LI,Sardines,"Crown Prince One Layer Brisling Sardines in Tomato, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0.99002665,1

These Mediterranean Style sardines are the best sardines I've tried. I've eaten six cans in the last week and a half. The spices and olives are great, and they complement and balance the brand's traditional smokey flavor. I could go with a few more black olive slices, maybe, as that flavor really works.

Aside from that, being brislings (the smallest of all commercial sardines), they are practically at the bottom of the food chain, which means (1) they should be almost completely free of mercury and any other toxins that accumulate in fish as you move up the food chain, and (2) their diet consists almost entirely of algae and phytoplankton that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These ""fish oils"" are not actually produced by fish, but by the microscopic plants and animals that the smallest fish eat. As a result, larger fish contain a smaller amount of these oils per unit of body weight. Most larger fish have a gram or less per serving, but Crown Prince brislings have 2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids, which is practically a medically therapeutic dose. So you get great taste and the maximum health benefits by eating these (though depending upon your taste, the same sardines are available in several varieties -- I just happen to prefer the ones in soybean oil).","Great taste, and good for you",B000EEZ3LI,Sardines,"Crown Prince One Layer Brisling Sardines in Tomato, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0.9977154,1

Fast forward a few decades and a matured palate with a desire for nutrient packed natural foods, I rediscover the wiggly little shimmering fish that seems more like bait than a real seafood meal.
Having tried most of the grocery store sardine fare I was less than impressed with the low dollar mushy chum offerings, many of which (*ehem cough* Beach Cliff, Chicken of the sea) I would think twice before feeding my Calico Tigger.

Crown Prince is a good product. The small tail-on two layer Brisling are fairly neatly packed in a standard olive oil bath. They are firm, meaning they were fresh when processed and not overcooked as many other brands often are.
These are smoked and as such are a bit on the high side for sodium. The smoke flavor is noticeable and not subtle in the least. This can be a good thing if you aren't looking to taste as much of the natural fish flavor, though if one is looking for a quality strong smoked fish at a bargain price I would suggest Polar 6oz kippered herring.

By and large you get what you pay for when it comes to fish in a can. Price is high (a bit more more than double) by comparison with the low end offerings, though less expensive than some top drawer brands like Barr Harbor and King Oscar. The best prices for canned fish can be found at WalMart and Big Lots though here on Amazon you can get a fair price if one of the aforementioned retailers are not near you.

In conclusion, if you want a good quality bristling sardine but can't either afford or find King Oscar, then by all means give this very good alternative a try.","Good Value, better than most.",B000EEZ3LI,Sardines,"Crown Prince One Layer Brisling Sardines in Tomato, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0.99769354,1

610,3,False,1280448000,"I recently re-read of how good sardines are for people, in ""EAT THIS, NOT THAT, BEST AND WORST FOODS IN AMERICA"" Edition.  Believe it or not, SARDINES were listed amongst ""the best foods you've never heard of"" (!)  I'll admit most of the other foods listed ARE somewhat new to me....but SARDINES?  I've been eating them since I can remember!  They are NOT a ""strange new food"" to me -- and, I hazard to guess, to most people in the western,(and pronbably also the eastern), world!

EAT THIS, NOT THAT, author David Zinzenco mentions that ""Crown Prince"" is the bargain brand of sardines, and -- always on the outlook
for a bargain, I decided to get some Crown Prince sardines.  This particular variety, 'CROWN PRINCE BRISTLING SARDINES IN OIL/ NO SALT ADDED"", caught my eye, because I've been eating a LOT of processed foods from the supermarket lately....most of them with a lot of salt.
After eating far too much, I could feel my heart going, ""pitter-patter, pitter-patter"", far too fast!  As there were no pictures of
my favourite movie or TV stars around, I knew this was a danger-sign I had eaten too much salt!

These sardines are packed in SOYBEAN oil -- not the olive oil recommended by Mr. Zinzenco.  They are tasty little morsels, and I, at least, don't notice any flavour gone because there is no added salt. (There IS salt -- sodium -- in these sardines, (125 milligrams per serving -- there is one serving listed, per can), but I guess this is only because the sea IS salty, and these sardines, (which are a WILD-CAUGHT, product of Scotland), do come from the sea.  But no salt is ADDED, and this should make for less salt than is had in other, salt-added sardines.

It is amazing, though -- despite the relative HUGE amount of soybean oil in each can -- that the sardines inside taste semi-dry.  I have read that the larger, ""skinless and boneless"" variety of sardines, (which are also offered by several manufacturers, and which I have also tried through the years), are not really sardines at all -- they are mackerel! Tasty morsels as well -- but very, very dry.  These CROWN PRINCE BRISTLING SARDINES are NOT THAT dry -- (and, from their somewhat smaller size, and included skins and bones, definitely seem to be sardines and not mackerel) -- but they ARE a good bit drier than any other fully skinned and fully boned sardines I have ever eaten.  This is my one caveat with these sardines.  However, they do have a lesser price, and they do have a lesser salt content.  So, if these things are important to you, a little dryness shouldn't really be a problem.  If it is, I suggest that you get another, fully salted variety of sardines, (perhaps from another manufacturer), open two cans, (one of each), at a time, mix them up, divide the mixture into halves, and put half of the mixture away, (in one of the cans), for another serving!

So, nothwithstanding a slight dryness, these less-expensive, less-salt
variety of sardines, may be just what you desire!  Yummy!",Y U M M Y......I N E X P E N S I V E......B U T.....S O M E W H A T.....D R Y,B000EEZ3LI,Sardines,"Crown Prince One Layer Brisling Sardines in Tomato, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0.99655825,1

You can find the recipe here
[...]

So we went to the super market and the only brisling sardines we can find in oil was King Oscar Sardines but it was almost 5 dollars a can and we needed two of them, well okay whatevers we got it.

We got home and made thie recipe... and for someone that hasn't ever had sardines before it was super yummers!  My b/f has had sardines before and said yup brislings is the way to go.  BTW if you were try this recipe at home, they say prep-time is 5 minutes which it is but there is a 1-hour wait time while the sardines soak in the sauce that you have to prepare for, we wanted to eat it right away and it was still pretty good, but since then we have waited and it is better if you wait.

Anyways being kind of a frugel person 10 bucks for protein is not what I call a low cost meal for a dinner for two.  Usually with that much chicken we can eat well for a week!  So I was like got to find Brisling Sardines cheaper... and that's where Amazon comes in.

This is a great deal for about half the price you can find it at local super markets and free shipping really knocked it out of the park for us.

I ordered this early last week and got it before the weekend.  I made the recipe this weekend and yup very good, I would say just as good as King Oscar Sardines.

627,5,False,1243641600,"I have recently read an article on salmon fishing, in ""BEST LIFE"" magazine.  It reports, sadly, that salmon, (and presumably other fish), taken from Norwegian seas has a very good chance of having a lot of pollutants, due to ""fish-farming"" in most of these waters.  The waters of Scotland come off much better than Norwegian waters -- even for wild-caught fish.  The Bristling Sardines from Crown Prince, here reviewed, are both from the waters of Scotland, AND are wild caught!  So, one can eat them without much of the fear of mercury or other poisoning, currently associated with eating fish!

Soybean oil may not be as good for one as Olive oil...but one does save by buying fish in soybean instead of olive oil.  The fish are covered with the oil, of course, but if one is careful, and s.l.o..w...(especially in taking off the flip top lid), the oil will stay mainly in the container, and not go onto table or into the sink.  The sardines are semi-dry -- and extremely tasty! The heads have all been cut off, of course...but some of the tails do remain.  The sardines are, indeed, ""packed like sardines""...very closely together.  One does get a full 3 3/4 ounces, as stated on the individual cardboard package in which each tin comes, and there is NOT an excessive amount of oil --just enough to keep the sardines covered and as moist as possible.  However, I do wish that Crown Prince -- and every other brand of sardines -- would list a ""Net DRAINED Weight"", so one could get an idea of how much fish, and how much, (usually uneaten) oil, is present.

The taste is adequate -- though I've had better from other brands.  However, a little bit of sugar, and/or spices, help with the flavour of anything.

I happen to love brisling sardines and eat them regularly with European style whole grain bread for lunch with iced tea.  I'm 100% Norwegian, so perhaps I have fish oil in my blood.

When I came upon this product I was very excited.  My local specialty grocer, Trader Joe's, recently discontinued offering King Oscar Cross Pack Extra Small Norwegian Brisling Sardines in olive oil and I was bereft, at least until I found these sardines from Crown Prince.  I immediately ordered two cases from Amazon.

These are acceptable sardines but I have to say they are decidedly second class when compared with those offered by King Oscar.  Perhaps it is the fact Crown Prince sardines are ""wood smoked"" that dries them out, but that is my primary objection.  King Oscar sardines are bathed in olive oil, moist and succulent.  Yes, the Crown Prince product has olive oil in the bottom of the can but the sardines themselves remain dry.  I've even taken to storing the boxes upside down in the hope the olive oil will permeate the sardines.  Thus far, my efforts have failed.  Perhaps the problem is the sardines themselves are a bit bigger than those ""extra small"" sardines from King Oscar.

Sadly, despite my communication with the producer and distributor, I've been unable to locate a vendor either locally or online who carry my preferred sardines in the distinctive black box.

In addition to that, there was what I thought was glass shards in it, but it turns out it's some sort of crystal called Struvite.  What a shocker that was to bite into, and a bit of a ruiner of the product.

734,5,True,1410739200,"I just placed another order for these (and I order the Crown Prince sardines all the time), and felt compelled to write a review after noticing some of the low reviews here.  The short version is this is very high quality canned salmon; some reviewers were either confused or maybe very unlucky (e.g. saw a couple with damaged cans).  Here are a couple of points to consider:

1.  Amazon lists this salmon (*with* bones) on the same page with smoked and/or boneless skinless salmon varieties, therefore the reviews for all 3 are combined.  While this is slightly confusing I admit, don't people read the product description before ordering?  A lot of reviews were surprised at the bones.  It states pretty clearly they are in there, in fact it's listed at the very top in the current presentation:  ""Traditionally packed to include the bones and skin for added calcium"".

2.  Even people who knew it had bones posted negatively about the vertebrae pieces in the salmon chunks.  I'm confused...did they think they would remove the vertebrae but leave the ribs?  Personally to make e.g. salmon salad for my daughter I found both the skin and bones easy to remove; for myself I mostly leave them in.  The most amusing part of this is at least one reviewer seemed to view the presence of vertebrae as a mark of inferior quality, when in fact the less processed something is, generally the better it is for you.  It is akin to saying a piece of fruit is ""bad"" because it has a blemish or something.

3.  A large percentage of the omega-3 in salmon is in or near the skin, because it is oily.  Go to Crown Prince's web site and compare the nutritional information between the boneless skinless and not.  If you are eating salmon for health reasons, you probably want to chop most of the skin up into your salmon salad (or whatever).  Or order their boneless skinless sardines instead, sardines are oily throughout so removing the skin doesn't reduce the omega-3 as dramatically as it does with salmon.

On the other hand, if you really don't want bones and skin....well, order the kind without them, or at least don't blame Crown Prince for your mistake, it's not their fault Amazon lists all 3 types of their salmon on the same page.",Great salmon at a decent price,B000EEWZG4,Salmon,"Crown Prince Natural Pink Salmon - Low in Sodium, 7.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0.99710256,1

756,5,False,1401321600,"The Alaskan pink salmon cannot be more than 3 years old while the Alaskan sockeye salmon can be up to 8 years old. More Alaskan pink salmon is harvested each year (by weight) than all other Alaskan salmon species put together. Thus, pink salmon is the smallest, youngest, and most plentiful of the Alaskan salmon. This means that you will probably save a huge amount of money and also get slightly more delicious salmon skin inside of each can than you would from canned Alaskan sockeye salmon. True, one can of Alaskan sockeye salmon has more fat than one can of Alaskan pink salmon. The meat of the Alaskan sockeye is higher in fat and higher in the beneficial carotenoid, astaxanthin, which gives salmon, trout, crabs, lobsters, shrimp, krill, flamingos, and some bacteria their red or pink color. Yes, the canned sockeye is slightly better than the canned pink but the price is almost twice as high. Interestingly, Masahide Kaeriyama compared the stomach contents of the Alaskan pink salmon against the stomach contents of the Alaskan sockeye salmon and discovered that: (1)both species of salmon are eating almost the exact same things when in the ocean, (2)squid is the favorite food of both species of salmon, comprising about one-fourth to one-third of their total diet, (3)red krill (a euphausiid) comprises less than 10% of the total diet of both species of salmon, (4)fishes comprise only about 5% of the total diet of both species of salmon, and (5)copepods, amphipods, decapods, pteropods, octopods, euphausiids, polychaetes, chaetognaths, ostracods, halocypridids, cumacea, gelatinous zooplankton, and barnacles were also found in the stomachs of both the Alaskan pink salmon and the Alaskan sockeye salmon. Because of different DNA, however, 1 pound of Alaskan sockeye salmon meat has 18.33mg of astaxanthin but 1 pound of Alaskan pink salmon meat has only 2.45mg of astaxanthin. Average amounts of astaxanthin contained in 1 pound of other salmon species: 2.55mg for Alaskan chum (keta, silverbrite) salmon, 6.26mg for Alaskan coho (silver) salmon, 4.04mg for Alaskan king (chinook) salmon, and 2.40mg for wild Atlantic salmon. Finally, wild salmon is considered even healthier for us to eat than farmed salmon, partly because wild salmon has better omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratios than farmed salmon. The average omega-3 to omega-6 ratios are as follows: farmed Atlantic salmon 2.55 to 1, wild Atlantic salmon 11.72 to 1, canned wild Alaskan sockeye salmon 10.94 to 1, canned wild Alaskan pink salmon 12.74 to 1, wild Alaskan chum salmon 12.31 to 1, wild Alaskan coho salmon 7.15 to 1, and smoked Alaskan king salmon (lox) 1.11 to 1.","If you can't afford canned Alaskan Sockeye Salmon, then canned Pink Salmon has advantages.",B000EEWZG4,Salmon,"Crown Prince Natural Pink Salmon - Low in Sodium, 7.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0.994503,1

I will not order Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Pacific Pink Salmon from Amazon again partly because Amazon significantly raised the price recently.

However, today, Amazon's subscription price (after a 15% discount) is $47.22, or $3.94 per can. This is a price increase of 34%, which is a price increase of $0.99 per can.

After I ordered the product on Sep 11, I consumed about 12 6-ounce cans during a period of about 6 weeks. I found the taste and texture to be OK, and the product is completely free of skin and bone, but the smell right after opening the can is noticeable and distracting compared to Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, Boneless & Skinless, which I prefer much more than the Crown Prince product. Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, Boneless & Skinless has noticeably better taste, texture, and smell.

Furthermore, the old-fashioned design of the Crown Prince can saddles the user with a major inconvenience: one must have a can opener to open the Crown Prince product. The Wild Planet product has a modern self-opening lid with a finger-ring on the lid so that one does not need a can-opener tool. An old-fashioned can without a self-opening lid is a big drawback for consumers. The modern self-opening lid is an important convenience for on-the-go consumers who want to eat the product right out of the can, especially when not at home.

Before I first ordered Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Pacific Pink Salmon on September 11, 2013, I had been consuming Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, Boneless & Skinless regularly for a period of about 12 months. According to the product labels, the Crown Prince product has a higher Omega 3 content than the Wild Planet product, and the Crown Prince product carries the BPA FREE label on the can. However, I prefer much more the taste, texture, and smell of the Wild Planet product.

(Note: Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, Boneless & Skinless does not carry the BPA FREE label, but, on its web site, Wild Planet discusses at length the substance BPA and whether its cans have the substance. BPA is a reference to a coating on the interior liner of some cans in the industry. Many governments have outlawed the use of BPA in can liners, but the US government has not outlawed such use of BPA, so, in pursuit of higher profits, some US corporations continue to sell cans that have BPA in the liner.)

Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Pacific Pink Salmon seafood comes from Pacific waters off the coast of Canada. Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, Boneless & Skinless seafood comes from Pacific waters off the coast of Alaska. I do not know if the habitat waters makes the difference, but I prefer much more the taste, texture, and smell of Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, Boneless & Skinless.

Before the time around July 2013, when Amazon discontinued subscription pricing for Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, Boneless & Skinless, the subscription price (after a 15% discount) was $3.07 per 6-ounce can. Due to unavailability of Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, Boneless & Skinless by subscription for $3.07 per can, on September 11, I ordered Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Pacific Pink Salmon because the price was much more affordable than the high prices for Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, Boneless & Skinless from Amazon's 3rd-party vendors. I am very disappointed with Amazon for cancelling subscription availability of Wild Planet Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, Boneless & Skinless, which had a relatively affordable subscription price (after a 15% discount) of $3.07 per 6-ounce can compared to the much higher and current prices ($3.80 to $5.92 or more per 6-oz can) of Amazon's 3rd-party vendors for the same product.

I do not intend to reorder Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Pacific Pink Salmon, and I will not pay the high price of Wild Planet Skinless & Boneless Wild Alaska Pink Salmon from Amazon's 3rd-party vendors. As soon as I find a seller who has an affordable price for wild Alaskan Pink salmon, boneless & skinless, I will order from that seller.

According to a Perdue University scientific study, canned salmon contains significantly less mercury (Hg) than most canned tuna and less mercury (Hg) than most canned mackerel. According to other abundant scientific data, North Pacific Pink salmon has the least amount of mercury (Hg) compared to the other four species of North Pacific salmon.

For all seafood consumers who want to know the scientific data about the actual amounts of mercury (Hg) content and the differences in mercury (Hg) content in salmon, tuna, and mackerel, read the findings of the study at the following non-commercial public-service site: cfse.purdue.edu/news/some-canned-fish-safer-for-women-in-childbearing-years/, and, at the bottom of the web page, download the actual scientific paper that contains the report and analysis by clicking the link: Mercury and Fatty Acids in Canned Tuna, Salmon, and Mackerel

Additionally, the Monterey Bay Aquarium has a EXCELLENT, free, and downloadable seafood guide on its non-commercial, public-service site, which is a superior reference for informed seafood consumers or those who aspire to be informed seafood consumers: montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/download.aspx","Taste, texture, and smell not as good as wild Alaska Pink salmon",B000EEWZG4,Salmon,"Crown Prince Natural Pink Salmon - Low in Sodium, 7.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",-0.99674386,1

789,4,True,1370304000,"I have been buying this salmon for several years.  I do so because wild Alaskan salmon is a very healthy food, i.e., it is a good source of healthy protein, omega-3 fatty acids, certain vitamins like D and B-12, certain minerals (e.g., calcium, phosphorus, selenium), etc.  Also, it has one of the lowest mercury contents for fish.  The advantage of this particular canned salmon is that it has no added salt.  In terms of taste, it is better than most of the common canned salmons found in our local supermarkets, but of course it is mediocre when compared to the taste of fresh salmon.  I use it exclusively for making the salmon analogue of tuna-fish salad and for making a tomato-based fish and vegetable soup.  In those cases, the added seasonings that I used make up for the relatively bland taste of the canned salmon.  In regard to the bones, they are very soft, so they can be easily ground up and included in your food.  The bones are a very good source of calcium and other nutrients.  The skin is a good source of anti-inflammatory compounds.  (I would only eat the skin from wild Alaskan salmon.  For other salmon sources, such as farmed salmon, higher concentrations of environmental toxins have been found to accumulate in the skin.)

The price for this canned salmon has been consistently increasing over the past few years, but Amazon usually has the best price.  Amazon prices jump around quite a bit on most of the food items that I purchase from them, so I usually wait until prices are at the lower end of the range before ordering.",Good Canned Wild Alaskan Salmon,B000EEWZG4,Salmon,"Crown Prince Natural Pink Salmon - Low in Sodium, 7.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0.9971734,1

Lived on the coast of British Columbia for 8 years and rarely caught a salmon that I didn't alder smoke; it's the native way and I learned it there and I've never found a better way to prepare salmon.
Previously I bought the Crown Prince Low Sodium Pink Salmon and thought it was great, figured I couldn't miss with the alder smoked version. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It's unbearably salty with no discernible hint of alder flavor. So disappointing. I had great hopes because I live where there is no alder, but this is too salty even for my dog. I can't eat it.

Pro Tip: Pink salmon vs Red Sockeye salmon aren't significantly different from one another in terms of nutrition.  While some may say that sockeye salmon is better tasting (which I don't necessarily agree, though that's not to say it isn't delicious), you just can't beat the price difference between red and pink.  Pink is cheaper and you get more of it!

The stuff tastes great.  While there's no question that fresh salmon will always taste better over canned, this is a very affordable route to get your fish fix that tastes better than any other sort of canned swimmer.

This salmon has skin and bones which add to the nutritional value, but Crown Prince also has skinless and boneless salmon if that is your preference.

If BPA is a serious issue for you I would recommend buying the boneless and skinless version for now.

835,3,True,1326240000,"I've never had canned salmon with no salt added before.  It is not bad, but it is different.  You can definitely taste the salmon, but in truth, I've had canned salmon numerous times before that had salt in it and it tasted like salmon, too.  The drawback on this particular canned salmon is that it does look like cat food.  If you remove the bones, any large pieces of fish are now in much smaller pieces.  This may work for you, but it isn't exactly what I've become used to with skinless and boneless versions.  The really strong argument for this product is that this is wild-caught Alaskan salmon at a good price.  Plus, if you need a no salt added version or the ability to control the level of salt with self-seasoning, this will definitely work.

I have considered buying the skinless and boneless version that Crown Prince puts out, but I have some reservations.  First off is the cost.  You pay more for cans that weigh less (though, maybe the 1.5 ounce weight difference is negated if you remove the bones and skin?).  Second, one reviewer said that the first can was so salty that the remaining eleven cans were going to be donated.  That is a pretty negative reaction, but three other reviewers gave the skinless and boneless version a full five stars.  Finally, the omega-3 seems to be less in the skinless and boneless version, too.  1.5g in the no salt version compared to 0.235g in the skinless and boneless version.  Though, if you end up picking out the skin and bones, doesn't that lower the omega-3 you are consuming?  So, perhaps that is a wash, too.  I guess I'm still not sure.

Our grocery stores have oodles of varieties of canned salmon.  This was the best tasting and the best value. And with its low sodium content of 50 mg per serving, I recommend this to my patients.

869,5,True,1284854400,"I bought the Crown Prince Alaskan Pink Salmon, no salt added, to cut down on my sodium intake.  I eat a lot of canned fish --- salmon, tuna and sardines --- but am not happy with the high sodium content in what is available in the supermarkets, Whole Foods excepted.

My low sodium diet is a self-imposed dietary restriction rather than a mandate from my physician.  I know that the human body requires only 500 - 700 mg of sodium per day under most conditions, but have found from tracking my dietary intake that it is difficult to get intake of sodium below perhaps 2400 mg/day unless I make a conscious, deliberate effort to do so.  This Crown Prince salmon has made the task a bit easier.

The salmon has become an invaluable, healthy part of my diet. I use it in large green salads and occasionally as a quick meal eaten directly from the can. Not elegant dining, perhaps, but it works for me.  I find the taste of the salmon to be quite good, as I have long since gotten used to eating unsalted and minimally salted foods.

When I made my original purchase thru Amazon on the 20th of July this year, I went on a 2-month subscription.  Under the subscription my second order of the salmon is due to be shipped tomorrow, the 20th of September.  As I finished off my last can of the original shipment a few days back, I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the new supply.","High quality, appetizing, healthy, tasty and reasonably priced",B000EEWZG4,Salmon,"Crown Prince Natural Pink Salmon - Low in Sodium, 7.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0.9977605,1

(4)Oysters are moderately rich in the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), both of which are the subjects of thousands of scientific studies on human disease prevention.  (5)Oysters are low in mercury and other marine pollutants.  (6)The salt content is just right to make it taste good and not excessive.  (6)These oysters taste good without being smoked.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a variety of fish and meats, I just can't stomach anything that looks like it is living!

In doing some research for my health, I kept seeing the praises of sardines because of their natural Vitamin D, low on the toxic scale for fish, as well as being full of Omega-3.

After much research, I bought these Crown Prince skinless & boneless sardines, probably held my breath and opened them wondering what I would see. How surprised I was to see delicious looking fish in olive oil, that looked nothing like the cheap cans of whole sardines!

One bite and I knew these were right for me! They are delicious, tender and almost melt in your mouth. I love to put them on salads and eat them with crackers.

Two of my children love them and will literally beg for them when I open a can!

For those not familiar with canned sardines, here are some uses:

> On a cracker, with or without cream cheese (tastes fantastic with a tiny smear of cream cheese)
> On toast with onion - a traditional way of eating sardines. Best on hearty bread (not white).
> On pizza.
> Can be used in fish cake recipes.
> Can be used in place of clams for your linguini and clam sauce recipe.
> Many other uses and recipes: check out chowhound's article, things to do with canned sardines
> Plain, right out of the can - fish lovers will appreciate the taste and quality of this product straight out of the can (flat can).
> Very good nutrition, a great source of protien and healthy fats (omega 3).
> Healthier than most other fish because the fish are small and haven't yet gotten the chance to be contaminated by toxins in the ocean. Small fish are usually healthier than larger fish, like tuna, for this reason.
> A perfect emergency preparedness food choice. They last long (usually 5-7 years after canning), they open easily without the need for a can opener, can be eaten with your fingers if you don't have a fork, good nutrition, cans are light weight, easy to store.

1047,1,False,1423699200,"My diet is fish, lots of fish, small fish in cans. Sardines are sold as sardines or Brisling sardines by Crown Prince. I get different sardines all the time especially in 15oz cans for a dollar since I have access to many fish stores. I always dump the mix that comes with the fish regardless of the brand or the type of fish from salmon to sardines to herrings to sprats since that is where the sodium and unwanted oil, water or tomato juice linger. The brisling sardine is a member of the fish family ""clupeidae,"" which includes herring, shads and sardines. In Norwegian, ""brisling"" refers to a herring like fish. Brisling sardines are found in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Labrador Sea southward to South Carolina along the eastern coast of the United States. Sardines with bone and skin offer more nutrients, four times more calcium.

Not brisling, not smoked, skinless and boneless, in olive oil not EVOO, salt 280mg, with 26g protein for 99g serving size, from Morocco. For $25 for sustainable harvested sardines, a reasonable buy but at $39 it is not although I pay much less than that in specialty stores. Why these producers sell the same item in a blue cardboard as well as white cardboard and charge twice for the same item is beyond me. But more importantly, I consume fish as my main protein source and I witness destruction of marine life all the time.

I have also noticed that the sardines are not packed very tight.  Rather than mainly sardines, it appears that they fill up the tin with more oil (???).
Maybe I just got a fluke the last time, because all the prior ones were fine.

If I ever buy them again, I will update my rating if they are better.  I probably won't buy them again though, because when the Crown Prince got so crazy high-priced a couple of months ago, I switched to Season Sardines in olive oil and I feel that they are far tastier than the Crown Prince ever were.

1089,5,True,1406505600,"I have been ordering the Crown Prince sardines for over a year and have nothing but praise for these awesome little cans. I needed to supplement my diet with more foods that had ant-inflammatory/Omega-3, which is typically fish. I already ate a lot of Salmon and adding more salt water fish could up the amount of mercury I'm consuming. I found that Sardines, being very close to the bottom of the ocean food chain are very light on mercury.

I couldn't recall the last time I tried them but ""Salty Taste"" seemed to be the memory. Turns out that ""Sardines"" is a term used to describe a large variety of fish, sometimes by the length or sub-type. It depends on the country, the U.S has three different ones alone. This lead me to do quite a bit of research, ending with Crown Prince. The advantage for me is three key points.

1. Boneless - With boneless, there is no mess. You just open the can and throw it into any dish your preparing or eat it right on the spot.
2. Olive Oil - At first I only did canned sardines with water. I kept seeing research items pop up about the Mediterranean diet which has its base in Olive Oil. Yes there is quite a bit of fat but it is saturated and not trans fat. It is a 2 for 1 special.
3. Quality product - It was not easy finding this product, sardines have not been popular as of late. In fact they peaked around 2000 and as such, quite a few factories have closed since that time. So far, this has been a very consistent product. I had a ring break once on a can and occasionally their is a little overflow of olive oil.

I also highly recommend the subscription service Amazon offers. It saves money and removes the hassle of remembering to stock up. I usually have a new 12 pack sent to me every 2 months.

Update - It has almost been 2 years and like clockwork my subscription gets refilled every 2 months by Amazon. The product has stayed very consistent as I have consumed several dozen cans.

These taste like good quality dark meat tuna to me, and they are not ""fishy"" smelling like anchovies. I like to eat them with sliced green onions and half an avocado on a pile of my homemade fermented sauerkraut (yay probiotics), and usually add extra pink salt and extra olive oil. A squeeze of lemon is nice too. You could add a bit of mustard if that's to your liking.

The 3oz can is not difficult to open, but a bit awkward to avoid cutting oneself. It only takes one nick, a little blood, and a little oil on the floor to figure it out!

So enjoy !!!

p.s.
Here a little taste at how we prepare them.
We used
2 1/2 plum tomatos chopped
1/2 of a small white onion finely diced
4 olives (pickled and stuffed with jalapeno(mild))roughly chopped
1 small pickled jalapeno finely chopped and seeded
juice from 1 1/2 limes
Kosher salt
fresh black pepper (depends on your taste)
just a few drops green tabasco sauce (jalapeno)

 Simple combine these items in a medium bowl and add the salt and pepper to taste
 Let it rest for a bit the jucies from the lime will cook the onion a bit...
 After a few minutes we added two cans of the sardines (drained and slightly broke up with fork)
 Folded it up and tasted. (add what you think is missing)
 We served it in the same bowl and ate it on some toasted baguette slices.

1233,5,True,1228521600,"I have been ordering low mercury tuna from Amazon for some time. The last time I ran out, Amazon was not selling the brand I was buying (wild planet) so I looked for alternatives.

I could not really find an alternative on Amazon.com that actually identified itself as ""low mercury."" Low mercury tuna that I could find outside Amazon.com is very expensive plus you have to pay shipping. One brand that Amazon does sell - Crown Prince - says that their tuna is Dolphin-safe and line caught. Usually, the line-caught and troll-caught tuna from the Pacific Ocean is lower in Mercury than the typical tuna you find from brands like Starkist and Chicken-of-the-Sea. I also read a story recently that the high amount of selenium in tuna actually helps bind with mercury in tuna to negate its effects.

According to several articles I found, the interactions between dietary selenium and mercury are now the topic of exciting new research. Some of those studies were presented at a recent scientific meeting dedicated to the subject. The First International Symposium on Selenium and Mercury Interactions, was held February 22-24, 2007 in La Jolla, California. The symposium assembled scientists from the US, Japan, Spain, Ireland, Slowenia, Denmark and elsewhere to share information on selenium and mercury interactions and health effects.

Of particular interest was a paper given by Dr. Nicholas Ralston of the Energy and Environmental Research Center in North Dakota on the biochemical basis of selenium's protective effects on mercury toxicity. Selenium has an extremely high binding attraction and strength with mercury, forming a biologically inactive compound, mercury selenide.

But how much selenium is in tuna? All tuna species sampled, including bigeye, yellowfin, albacore and skipjack contained a healthy excess of selenium over the mercury content. For this reason, eating tuna, an excellent source of selenium, is more likely to protect against mercury toxicity, than cause it.

So, that was enough for me to give this tuna a try. From Amazon, it comes in a 12-pack case with free shipping. The price per can is very good. The tuna tastes great and the 12-oz can is a good size for me and my wife who like to mix it with low fat miracle whip, mustard, chopped onions, and green & red peppers and eat it with corn chips or make paninis.

These are good quality though not dramatically better than the cans I've picked up at random in the store. The oil is neutral rather than having that harsh taste you sometimes get with cheap oil, and the anchovies have just the right amount of saltiness.

The jar gives you one big advantage and another equally big disadvantage. The advantage is that you can take what you want and not feel compelled to use the whole jar, or conversely not feel bad about opening a new package when you just need one or two anchovies. The disadvantage is that it's really difficult to get the pieces out of the jar in whole fillets that look nice on pizza. You CAN do it but you should plan ahead and do this before you cook: go at the jar with a skewer or maybe a toothpick, gently raise the pieces out and be prepared for a few failures.

Then, after you've used the jar, don't throw it away or recycle it.

It was not in a rectangular shape any longer. After opening it I saw that the good people at Amazon had wrapped the whole case of jars with bubble wrap. I felt much better when I saw this. I even had trouble getting the wrap off the case of jars, but when I did,the first thing I smelled was Anchovies. Not good! Then I saw that a quarter of the top of the case was wet with olive oil. Even worse! Then I saw that the tape that Crown Prince had sealed the case up with had been cut open. I don't think it would have made it out their door this way personally. Now I love Amazon and spend so much money with them I should be part owner by now, but I will have to say this was done at their warehouse and someone saw the oil on the case and cut it with a knife to look inside the case and just shipped it anyway. I have four jars that are covered in oil and no way of knowing really which ones are leaking. I suspect that it must be one or all of those four. Now while I have not looked close enough at the four yet to see if there is a fine crack in the bottles or the lids are loose, I have read in others comments where their jars were broken.

I'm pretty sure that when it comes to the nutritional powerhouse that clams just happen to be, most people either are unaware or just don't care how many key nutrients are provided by these little mollusks.  One little 3 oz. tin has 130% of the iron we need in a day and although it isn't listed on the nutritional label, clams are the best source of vitamin b12 on the planet at over 1000% per serving. Certainly not recommending to eat a whole tin everyday for health but half a tin every other day(refrigerate leftovers of course) will do the body good. Simply, put some good old clams = anemia's worst enemy.  Now back to how these clams packed in olive oil annihilate all other canned clams out there. Canned clams, even other Crown Prince canned clams have a knack for providing more SAND than clam. That's right, it's usually a grainy experience.  But not with these CP Natural in Olive Oil. Delicious and actually does this healthy treat some justice. Being a huge fan of the CP Natural canned oysters in olive oil, I just had to try these.

I already knew that Campbell's put tiny pieces in their chowder, and I thought I went overboard when (accidentally) the can half dropped out.  It still didn't have any clam taste.  I can go to the store and buy them for crazy prices, but this is even more crazy.  I finally ate my soup, and I had half a can of the clams left.

I decided to just eat the rest out of the can.  There was no flavor at all.  It literally tasted like wattery rubber.  No clam or seafood taste at all.  These are terrible, and maybe I got a bad batch, but I'd never order them again considering their price.  I can get cheaper clams at my local grocery store that are fresh.  I just bought these for the times that I don't have that option and for storage.

In all, yes, I can't rate these more than 1 star.  No flavor, okay texture be it more rubbery than steamed fresh clams.  I wasted almost $30 for 12 small cans which are 5 ounce net weight by the way, not 10 ounces of clam.

Crown Prince - Your current product is not acceptable in taste or texture.  Worse, it is not acceptable to use China as a source of food, especially for a ""high end"" product such as this.  Don't believe me?  Google ""government and regulators struggle to ensure quality of that nation's exported food"" and read the article that states ""The misuse and overuse of hundreds of chemicals, many of them banned and toxic, have led to death for scores and sickness in hundreds of thousands of people throughout China."" and ""The problem affects not only China but also the United States and other countries that import Chinese-grown and processed food.""

I'm a big fan of Crown Prince smoked fish and these clams do not disappoint.  The can is filled with smallish clams packed in olive oil.  They have a very light flavor and are delicious.

BUT, just to round out my midnight sardine buying spree  (that one can- or maybe the Blue Planet series- really wet my appetite, i guess), i also ordered these Viga oily, salted, skin and bone fish for myself.

ok. well.  i've eaten nearly (my husband stole some of one can as i was scarfing) 4 cans of the viga since yesterday when i got the shipment..... i know it's not good to have too many omega-3s, so i'll try to control myself now.  But,  YUUUUUUMMMMMM!!!!!!  i went back on-line today, and ordered what turns out to be the last case... sorry folks.  i'm really hoping Amazon brings these back.  i can't believe how delicious these Viga lemon are.  the slice of lemon (in the can, as noted by one reviewer) is similar to the moroccan preserved lemon (i love moroccan food)-very soft, very mild, nearly sweet lemon slice.  the flavor of the fish is a thing wonderously oily and richly satisfying- as only skin and bone can add, i believe.  Although I also liked all the other sardines i bought, the no oil, no salt, no skin and no bones....well, it's a health thing i guess- but i prefer those with hot sauce or onions or mustard, etc.... the reese and roland also tasted like tuna in a can- not bad for that kinda thing- i was thinking i'd need to actually mix them with mayo for a sardine-fish sandwich - again, not bad- still feels good after eating, but not something quite i'm craving-- unlike this viga with lemon.  i think i could eat this everyday, easily.  quite delicious.  Re: the brisling crown prince variety, i think those who like the size/shape and lightly smoked ""traditional"" flavor will like the crown prince.

I enjoyed one review (can't remember which sardines) from a guy who mentioned that he started his cat on sardines, and that his cat is like a ""new cat.""  I love these so much--- i wonder if i'll become like a new cat?

anyway, if you like, as another reviewer said, ""the real thing,""  i would highly recommend these.  Since i'm not an expert on spanish sardines, i just don't really know if these are not as complex as yet another reviewer noted (see other non-lemon Viga reviews)-  but, all my Viga cans and boxes were clean with expiration dates (unlike the reese) and, i thought they were just super scrumptious fabutastic.  if these are the less flavorful /less complex types of spanish sardines, i really will make an effort to try other varieties!","flavorful, delicious, amazing",B000FDP6IS,Sardines,"Vigo Sardines in Oil with Lemon, 4.375-Ounce Cans (Pack of 10)",0.99764544,1
1444,5,True,1239840000,"In the politically correct age in which we live, ""skinless and boneless"" sardines have invaded supermarket shelves promising an appropriate and civilized eating experience. If that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. These are the real thing.  And as they are definitely the anthesis of skinless and boneless, I guess we need to name them for what they really are, tell it like it is, and refer to them as skinny and boney. While this may sound a bit rough around the edges, well, what the heck.

Before going any further I have to disclose that I eat sardines every day for lunch. I've tried `em all, and these plump pilchards are right up there among the best.

Generally I've operated from the premise that Portuguese sardines are superior, but these are increasingly expensive and sometimes hard to find. So when the local gourmet food store forgot to place my order I looked for an alternative and came across this Spanish substitute. At this juncture my knowledge of geography stood me in good stead as I realized that the Atlantic waters off of Portugal are contiguous with those of Spain, and clearly the fish know no boundaries in between. How different therefore could they be at less than one third the price?

This seemed too good to be true and when I noted that they are packed in a combination of soy and olive oil rather than olive oil alone, my suspicions were aroused. Subsequent research into the matter uncovered the finding of the American College of Chest Physicians that soy oil contains omega 3 fatty acids. Sardines themselves are rich in these most beneficial substances so immersing them in more of the same could only seem to make a good thing better. And, with the addition of lemon (a real lemon slice right in the tin) the eater also benefits from the intake of vitamin C.

Anyway, to cut to the chase I'll simply say that these fish taste great.

I do, however, perform a quick dissection prior to indulging.","Skinny, Boney, and Juicy (Lemon That Is)",B000FDP6IS,Sardines,"Vigo Sardines in Oil with Lemon, 4.375-Ounce Cans (Pack of 10)",0.9975378,1

I've been trying to include more oily fish in my family's diet, and while I like cooking meals for them all the time, sometimes I wanted a quick protein to add to their meals/snacks.  The Season Sardines are a fantastic canned sardine.  The can is jammed packed filled with the little fish.  These fish are whole (minus heads, fins, and guts) and sit in a lightly salted olive oil.  There are some scales and small bones on the fish, all of which are edible.  I looked it up online, and found that if scales are removed from sardines, the skin will soften and the fish will fall apart.  I personally don't mind the bones or minuscule scales in there since I figure - more calcium!  The kids and husband don't seem to care either.

For those who are opposed to very ""fishy tasting"" fish, this is a good option to consider.

We take linguine fine, or thin spaghetti, olive oil, toasted bread crumbs, fresh garlic toasted a bit in the olive oil, capers (for those who don't like capers, you can substitute some sea salt but it's missing that nice floral scented flavor), lemon juice, and sardines mashed up and maybe remove some of the bones if there are squeamish folks who cannot stand seeing that little bones in the food.

My interest is not sodium or extra calories from cheap oils even when it is claimed VOO since no producer is going to offer high quality EVOO and olive oil is not EVOO at all, it is OO and it does not even come close to the nutritional value of EVOO, although OO is not as damaging oil as other cheap oils.

These are complete sardines and quantity wise offer half an ounce more, 4.37 vs. 3.75. Skin and bones offer more calcium, natural oil and different taste than when one purchases a can of sardines that are skinless and boneless where one can only taste solid flesh, only the meat of the sardine. Protein is the same where they claim 24g of fish protein but you will miss out on calcium and many other nutrients without the skin and bones. One needs to read the labeling very carefully before purchase since there are so many variations. For two buck a can, it offers it all except item #3 above. You can get the same thing with item #3 which is better for your health. Seasons offers that but it is in a different can and worth every penny.",Price & Quality Matters...,B000HDMW8S,Sardines,"Season Sardines in Pure Olive Oil, 4.375-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)",0.9957565,1

Also, it's not possible to eat these with the olive oil as a condiment, since the olive oil is pretty gross.

That's how we roll.

Smaller fish like sardines, anchovies, and herring tend to be low in contaminants/pollution/etc. and high in omega-3 fats. That makes them an excellent anti-inflammatory food for both of us -- and possibly less contaminated than larger fish like wild-caught salmon. Kitty needs no added salt & I find these delicious. Some reviewers dislike the fact that these are not highly processed (complain about the bones, scales, etc.) but we find this a plus. With the global olive oil market awash in fake & substituted vegetable oils, we also prefer sardines packaged in water. So many positives: NOT from China; certified non-GMO; certified sustainably fished; wild-caught in the Atlantic (product of Morocco); about 120 mg sodium in the entire can, which is BPA-free. Kitty scarfs them down enthusiastically as is; I like to use the recipe Alton Brown used to lose so much weight while still eating well: Sardine-Avocado Open-Faced Sandwiches (you can google the recipe).

I like these because they have no added salt or oil, which would not be good for her.  Every time I open a new can for her, I take a bite of them myself, and I have found that I like them, too!  Actually, I am on a diet where I eat plain tuna once every week, and last week I decided to substitute a can of these sardines for the tuna.  They were really good!  I think they are a good quality product, and I like that they have no added salt. The soft bones are a good source of calcium.

I had been eating these mackerels from Season-- specifically, ""In Water, No Salt Added""-- for years, finding them quite satisfactory. (I cannot compare with other mackerel products on the market, as I have not tried any that I can recall.) Starting at some point within the last year or two, however, I encountered at least one batch of the product and possibly more that obviously had to have been mislabeled; it clearly and unmistakably tasted MUCH SALTIER than it ever had before in all the years that I had been consuming it.

Then, in March (2016), I encountered at least one can, from a case of twelve that I had purchased, that appeared to be packed in some type of OIL; not in the water that, throughout all the years that I had been using the product, i had always found it to be packed-in before. I underscore that in both cases-- with the mackerels that contained added salt as well as with the ones that appeared to be packed in oil-- the boxes were labeled, ""In Water, No Salt Added"". I would always check carefully and verify this before opening a box.

On March 22nd, I reported the problems that I described above to the company, using the email address that I got from the Season web site ( [...] ). A week later, having not received any reply to my email, I re-sent it. Still nothing. Finally, on April 12th, some three weeks after sending my initial email, I received a reply requesting that I provide the UPC for the product-- something I had already done in my initial email. I replied that same day, quoting and highlighting the portion of my original email that contained the UPC. It has now been nearly six weeks and I have yet to receive any further response from Season/Manischewitz.

In conclusion:
The ""Season Skinless & Boneless Mackerels in Water, No Salt Added"" that I had enjoyed for a number of years-- the one that I had no reason to believe was anything other than the product indicated on the label-- was a fine product that I would rate at least four stars. As described above, however, I have encountered numerous cans during the past one-to-two years that, if not mislabeled, had one or more mysterious and quite severe problems. To make matters worse, my attempts at reporting the problems to Season have been met with an absolutely abysmal lack of response. For these reasons, I cannot rate this product any higher than one star. Should I see the problems rectified, I will consider raising my rating.

The reasons behind my decision to write this review can be summarized as follows:
1.) To alert others of what to watch-out for when purchasing this product,
2.) To encourage others who had the same or similar experiences as mine to report them (I can't imagine that there aren't any and even /many/ such others and I am quite puzzled to not find any in the reviews here),
and.
3.) To pressure Season/Manischewitz to finally respond-to the very serious quality control and customer problems that are evidenced in my report.

I know the kind with skin and bones are very different from this but since I'm new to this sardine thing I was wary about what I was getting, so this seemed like a safe bet.

King Oscar is pretty expensive in the store (tho the W has a cross pack tiny fish version that is very reasonably priced which I've tried too but they're harder to deal with for me at this point) and Amazon's price fluctuates so hang in there and you can get these for a good price as it changes often.

I find these skinless, boneless, in olive oil sardines very easy to eat as is, on crackers, over eggs, just very simply. Will definitely buy again.

When buying the twelve-pack the price is about 30 cents cheaper per can than what I find in my local market. They come shipped in a King Oscar corrugated cardboard case in what I imagine is the same packaging as if they were being shipped to a supermarket.

I have tried every brand, and I think that King Oscar sardines are the best. Be warned that not all sardines are created equal. Many different species of fish can be labeled ""sardines"" and many are far bonier, fishier, and larger than these tasty treats. King Oscar sardines are ""Brisling"" Norwegian sardines that are smaller than other varieties. They have their tails on, are small enough that you can eat a single sardine in one bite, and the texture is free of any bones. I find that the ""Mediterranean"" variety, which comes packed with spices and black olives, is great as-is on a cracker or served on toast spread with mashed avocado.",Tasty Brisling Sardines,B000KOUKK6,Sardines,"King Oscar Sardines in Extra Virgin Olive Oil Mediterranean Sardines, 3.75 Ounce (Pack of 12)",0.9976764,1

2185,5,True,1423785600,"I wasn't certain what to expect when I ordered these.  I have eaten the King Oscar cross packed, Brisling two layer and Tiny Tots which are all fine sardines in extra virgin olive oil (the best oil for quality sardines) and they are all of excellent quality.  These Mediterranean sardines are single layer sardines.  But; not the single layer type found in the cheap sardines.  These are slightly larger than the double layer sardines by King Oscar and they also are of superb quality.  The seasoning is light and does not overpower the delicate flavor of the sardine. As usual this reflects the quality of the King Oscar brand. The cheap single layer brands have 3 - 4 sardines in a can (which may be packed in soybean oil) but these are 14 - 16 per can.  Enjoy them while they are still available as who knows when the labor costs for hand packing will make them unprofitable to market.  Unlike the Mediterranean spicing the Spicy cracked pepper sardines are not nearly as good.  Spice is supposed to enhance and not over power.  The amount of Black pepper that is used in the spicy cracked pepper sardines completely over powers the delicate flavor of the small brisling sardines and does them a disservice.  And I am a user of black pepper (and white pepper) in greater amounts than average.  But the King Oscar spicy cracked pepper sardines are overboard in their application of the peppercorns and cracked pepper (at least in the 12 pack I have).",The Mediterranean sardines are a nice flavorful sardine (not so for the cracked pepper sardines),B000KOUKK6,Sardines,"King Oscar Sardines in Extra Virgin Olive Oil Mediterranean Sardines, 3.75 Ounce (Pack of 12)",0.9978111,1

2187,5,True,1423008000,"Like most of the reviews, I was moved by Alton Brown's sardine toast episode and recipe (btw, I also eat it without the toast like a salad to cut out the carbs). I like to experiment a lot so I ended up getting a few different brands (Costco, Trader Joe's, Crown Prince). From a comparison standpoint, King Oscar is the best from both taste and texture standpoint.

Trader Joe's sardines (boneless/skinless and whole in harissa) have a tougher tuna texture and fishiness. I don't mind it, but in comparison, it doesn't stand up. Also, I do notice the bones in larger sardines. Not enough to be a choking hazard, but I do notice the grind between my teeth. The Costco boneless skinless sardines (can't remember brand) is the same as TJ's. They're a nice and maybe healthier alternative to tuna, but not as good as King Oscar.

Crown Prince was pretty good as far as texture went, but seemed a bit more salty and fishy.

2287,5,False,1367712000,"Simple review: if you are someone who has tried sardines and think they are disgusting, QUIT BUYING 99 CANS AT THE GROCERY STORE AND THINKING THAT IS ALL THAT IS OUT THERE.

There are plenty of brands out there in cheap tins for under a buck at most grocery stores, and the bulk of them are total garbage.  Mustard, tomato, lemon, hot sauce, doesn't matter, none of that helps.  You open the tins and they reek of fish, and make your friends/family/co-workers complain about the smell.  And the fish are soft, mushy, and totally fall apart on a fork.

These King Oscar sardines are perfect to introduce or re-introduce yourself to what was once a ""working man's delicacy.""  There was a time when almost every working man had a tin or two of sardines in his lunch pail as a snack, or part of a mean.  Consumption of canned fish probably peaked in the 1950s, and that was a time period when the best fish people could expect to have away from the ocean was canned.  Maybe people being better off with higher middle-class incomes made sales fall for the past 50 years . . .

Of all the brands available at most stores you could say these King Oscar sardines are a ""premium"" brand.  I would say more mid-priced.  There are probably many small manufacturers in Europe that offer different, distinct products made of different fish with different recipes.  I've seen some import food stores that offer a small variety, but usually at a pretty premium price.  All I can say is that for a little more than $2 a tin these King Oscar sardines are the best you can get for a small investment.  The olive oil makes the best packing flavoring (skip all the other flavors used to mask the taste of poor quality fish).  These fish have no overpowering smell when you open the can.  They are packed nicely, by hand, and have a very light smoke flavor in the flesh from being cooked.  Eat them with a fork, on some bread as a sandwich, or mixed into some greens for a light salad.  You can't go wrong: these are the best you can get for a small investment.  Consistent quality and great taste.

I've always been a fan of their canned sea-food products and buy a lot of canned shrimp and clams from them. Canned shrimp in our store here in Alaska is about $4.00 a can. Way out of my budget. But there are so many yummy meals I can make with this shrimp, that I needed to find an alternative. Amazon (being the wonderful place that it is) had these cans at a much cheaper price with free shipping. I've purchased them four or five times now from Amazon.

The cans are always very full. The miniature shrimps are packed tightly with a bit of water. I typically give the water to my cats as a treat. The pure shrimp often upsets their stomach- but the shrimp-flavored water is a huge hit with them. The cans always come with an expiration date over a year away. The cans are never dented or incorrectly packaged. As for the shrimp, themselves, they're all uniformly sized (usually about as big as a nickel) in diameter. They're never over-salted. In fact they taste really mellow in flavor compared to other canned sea foods I've eaten. But I like them.

My main concern with this particular brand is that you never know where your shrimp are coming from. I've had cans where the shrimp was raised in Indonesia. Other times they've been from China. Sometimes Bumble Bee offers American-grown products, but I've never had shrimp labeld 'raised in the USA' through this brand. My main concern is that China has very lenient laws when it comes to shrimp farming. They're often fed human feces and are raised in areas where chemical pollution is evident in the water. Obviously I don't want to eat shrimp that have eaten other peoples waste. So I'm always sad when I receive a batch of cans from China. I honestly can't taste the difference- but the mentality of it makes me lose my appetite. I'd prefer I always receive the Indonesian shrimp (a place not as notorious for bad-quality as China).

Nevertheless, for the price, I can't complain. It's impossible to find other canned shrimp products for as affordable as Bumble Bee brand. So until my budget allows me to opt for shrimp grown in more reputable parts of the world, I'll continue to buy this brand. They are super yummy! I just wish them weren't from a place where quality food-production is not highly praised.","Great Price, But Iffy-Quality",B000KOWGHQ,Seafood,"BUMBLE BEE Tiny Shrimp, High Protein Food, Keto Food and Snacks, Gluten Free Food, High Protein Snacks, Bulk Canned Shrimp, 4 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0.9977221,1

I never imagined that I would ever be able to have the gluten free equivalent of ""tuna helper"" or ""hamburger helper."" When I tried this boxed meal, I knew I had found a winner, and my (non GF) husband agreed. The corn noodles are very tasty and we both enjoy them equally- and the creamy, cheesy sauce is simple but goes very nicely with the tuna. I usually add some kind of fresh or defrosted vegetable- peas, green beans, etc. to the dish while it is simmering and then serve it with freshly chopped tomatoes and red or orange diced peppers on top. I doctor mine up with some freshly ground pepper and vietnamese hot sauce, but my husband likes it plain. Very, very good. My husband likes to make this when it is his night to cook, and I'm all too happy to let him. It may not be the most gourmet food product, but it's not horrible for you if you use lowfat milk, and it really is tasty for such a quick, easy GF meal.

PS I do have to say that this is my favorite of the Mrs. Leepers meals, perhaps because we don't eat meat or chicken. However, I do think the corn pasta and cheesy sauce is a real winner and superior to the other sauces and pastas. (For example, her chicken alfredo box meal is based on a rice pasta... it's ok, but seems a little lacking...)","It's not gourmet, but it's tasty and easy for weekday nights!",B000LKXFBK,Tuna Fish,"Mrs. Leeper's Creamy Tuna Dinner, 7.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0.9978525,1

2369,2,False,1347667200,"***Please see addendum below original review!

In my extended family, we have diabetics, low carb-ers and a few who are gluten intolerant. I tried the Mrs Leeper's creamy tuna but we find it's on the bland side and just not as tasty as Tuna Helper.

Instead I buy gluten free pasta and low carb pasta and packages of Tuna Helper (which I get for around 1.70 each) and I make two separate Tuna Helpers, one using gluten free pasta and one using low carb pasta. It's no more expensive than buying the Mrs. Leeper tuna dinners and in fact is probably a bit cheaper, it tastes better and I can satisfy the needs of both the diabetics and the gluten intolerant members of the family. I can also add as little or much pasta - either low carb or gluten free - as is necessary for how many people will be eating it. Like alot of the other reviewers, I also add more tuna than the recipe calls for and a veggie.

My husband and I are both type 2 diabetics. I save the regular pasta that comes in the Tuna Helper meal and when I have guests who can eat regular pasta, I serve it to them so we all get what we need/want and I'm not wasting anything.

One last thing is that Tuna Helper comes in several varieties so we don't get tired of it. I serve it probably at least once a month.

**ADDENDUM: Please note that this does work for my family however as a commenter pointed out, there are different kinds of gluten intolerance/sensitivity. We eat the ""Tettrazini"" and ""Parmesan"" flavors of Tuna Helper and the three members of my extended family who are gluten sensitive (they have not been diagnosed with celiac disease) have had no problems with either so long as they substitute the gluten free noodles for the regular pasta but this may not be suitable for everyone.

2410,5,True,1343347200,"I was buying the Star Kist Select low sodium chunk light  but when it became temporarily unavailable I ordered this tuna instead.  It is every bit as good as the Star Kist. There is nothing in the can but yellow fin tuna and water. The tuna is mostly large intact chunks like you get with solid white albacore but it's not albacore which is better since it's the big more mature albacore that has accumulated  more mercury.  This tuna has more juice in the can than the Star Kist Select and that may be why the cans say six ounces instead of five. Still it Is very good tuna and because there is no added sodium my cat gets to eat it too and she loves the juice.  Something else nice about this tuna is the can.  I use a Good Grips opener, the kind that cuts the lid off at the seam and leaves no sharp edges.

When I unboxed the 12 pack, I saw the ""Best Used By"" stamp read Aug 2016.  I received my order in Jul 2016.
-- This means these have been sitting around for at least 2 years.

I opened a tin and tried a few Oysters. Grey in color.
- The texture of the Oysters were mushy, not solid, hard to remove without falling apart - indicating they were breaking down with age.

They are packed (canned) by Cannorsa in Galicia in the NW tip of Spain. Cannorsa's quality is well certified (ISO 9001, BRC, IFS & MSC). The MSC certification means that they comply with or exceed sustainable harvesting guidelines.

Upon opening the can, the sardines' appearance reveals that they have been handled with utmost care and skill from the beginning. I've always found them packed 3-4 per can,and they are plump, well trimmed and about as pristine as a canned sardine can look. In short, picture perfect and able to make a fine presentation on any plate.

As sardines go, I find the flavor to be somewhat milder than most, which I attribute to prompt, expert canning by loving (at least, respectful) hands. They taste clean, pure and are complimented by the fine Spanish olive oil. Very simple and enjoyable. Finest European quality. Although there are scales on these, they are so small, thin & tender, they will very likely go unnoticed and at any rate do not detract from the experience at all. If you still think that scales may be a problem for you, I assure I wasn't even aware of them until I saw a loose one on my fork. By comparison, most people think nothing of bits of popcorn kernels which are many times more toothsome and noticeable. It may be difficult to find canned sardines that surpass these in quality.

2526,5,False,1327881600,"Once, years ago whilst working in a faraway land I sat down to eat with a co-worker who had upon his plate a heaping helping of fish bodies swimming in a tomato sauce.  ""What, pray tell, are those"" I queried?  ""Sardines,"" he said, to which I replied ""No.""  We settled the dispute by fishing out the can from the garbage and ascertaining that it did indeed state 'Sardines' on the label.  I was flabbergasted, having had no idea that a sardine can be as large as a plate as th0se were, or as small as a pinkie finger as many of these King Oscar Tiny Tots are....but let's face it:  Nobody wants to eat a humongous sardine.  In fact, doing so is antithetical to the meaning of the small fish, it's oxymoronic, and downright distasteful to do so, possibly even disrespectful.

In the years since then whenever I got the craving for sardines I would buy a can of them, usually in mustard sauce, then catch myself thinking that I remembered sardines being tiny fish packed, well, like sardines in a can, and the ones I was buying seemed relatively large....generally as large as the can was wide and meaty such that they would quite overwhelm the saltine cracker I placed them on, and they tasted like fish.  I'm not complaining, I'm from a state that was famous for its sardines and the ones I was eating were often caught and processed there....I just thought that Sardines were, by their nature, tiny.

It turns out that the name Sardine is a term similar to Beer.  In other words, lots of different kinds of fish get to be called Sardines but to me and likely to most people, classic sardines are meant to be small and Brisling: The kind of fish that can be stacked two high in a can as small as a sardine can. There is another fish called the Sild harvested in Scotland that is just as or nearly as small which I suppose makes it too a classic sardine, but most of the others that we eat over here in the US are slightly larger with more dark flesh and a fishier taste.  Them are good, but these are better!!!

In fact, these are great.  They are great because they are tiny (most are 3"" in length), of delicate white meat (with a section of dark) and a wonderfully neutral sardine flavor that pairs well with a dash of Tabasco and a Saltine.

Even better than their flavor is the visual impact of their sleek, fat, glistening, silver-sided bodies packed end to end in their palm-sized, aluminum, pull-top can which neatly evokes the turn-key steel sardine cans of my childhood.  It's a picture almost too pure to sully with a fork or knife, luckily that ephemeral beauty remains up until the last body is pulled from the can and laid out upon its cracker and finally consumed with respectful appreciation.

I myself am annoyed at how much research it takes to understand the marketing of salmon.  As you will see later in this review, much of this confusion could easily be avoided by simple changes to the labeling and advertising practices of SeaBear and Amazon...

... But it's good stuff anyway.

So, I ate 4 different SeaBear products in the past 6 months and received 3 more today, as well as my first from a competing brand (hopefully, I may be able to report on that one later).  I also have ready access to fresh salmon and eat that too.

And for the curious (like me), there is Wikipedia and the broader wealth of information on the internet.  Thus, the info I gathered from my previous (consumed) orders, examining the packaging of the latest (un-consumed) orders, some background research, and some stuff learned from ordering experience, is probably worth passing on.  If anything changes, I will update accordingly.

HOT-SMOKED IT IS, THIS ISN'T COLD-SMOKED LOX

Firstly, there are two main types of smoked salmon: Cold-Smoked and Hot-Smoked.  Hot-smoked is actually fully cooked.  I greatly prefer that over the cold-smoked type, which is essentially raw fish with some smoke on it.

But many others prefer cold-smoked raw fish.  Cold-smoked is often referred to as lox.  For some reason, international airlines love to throw cold-smoked salmon into appetizers and salads.  So if you've had salmon while airborne (other than as the main meal), it was probably cold-smoked.

This SeaBear product on the other hand is hot-smoked fully-cooked salmon.  Some of the people who expressed disappointment with this product were clearly thinking that they would receive the ""not-really-cooked"" cold-smoked salmon instead of this fully-cooked hot-smoked salmon.

Hot-smoked salmon comes with juices in the package that are usually drizzled (by the consumer) over the salmon and folded, forked, or otherwise worked into the flakes of meat to moisten it further.  How much juice to put on the fish (and work back in) is a personal preference.  The salmon usually tastes perfectly fine as it is, but if lots of moisture is what you are after, then working the juice back is what you will want to do.

SeaBear's hot-smoked products use a variation of a cooking method pioneered by the aboriginal peoples of the Northwestern region of North America: cooking over an alder wood fire.  SeaBear's cooking method involves smoking the fish first, then they are put into foil pouches and hot-cooked fully in the pouch.  This tends to impart a medium-strong flavor in all of their hot-smoked salmon products.  The strength of the flavor can vary slightly depending on the variety of salmon used by SeaBear for the base ingredient.  The smaller (and coincidentally cheaper) varieties of salmon have smaller fillets and flakes, and take on a slightly stronger flavor.

It is fair to say that once you have tasted a SeaBear hot-smoked salmon product, then experimenting with another variety of SeaBear hot-smoked salmon product is merely a refinement.  Each has it's own minor characteristics, but the overall SeaBear hot-smoked taste has it's own unmistakable signature that comes through regardless of the salmon species.

WILD PACIFIC SALMON IT IS, NOT ATLANTIC FARMED

This isn't Atlantic salmon, it is Pacific salmon.

In an era long since faded into the history books, Atlantic salmon used to be primarily caught from the wild as a common food product.  Unfortunately, the fishermen came pretty close to exterminating the Atlantic salmon as a species.  They had plenty of help from land owners and other people who destroyed much of the Atlantic salmon's nursery habitat, back-filling and polluting critical breeding streams and rivers.  Sadly, the wild Atlantic salmon never recovered.

Thus, there is very little commercial wild Atlantic salmon available in the market.  That isn't to say that there aren't any Atlantic salmon in the market though, because farmed Atlantic salmon are very popular and fill where wild Atlantic salmon products cannot.  In my local markets, fresh farmed Atlantic salmon are plentiful.

Wild Pacific salmon populations are under pressure, but are in significantly better condition than their wild Atlantic cousins.  Let's be hopeful that controls are adequate to keep the breeding population of wild Pacific salmon going.

Even with adequate controls to protect the breeding population, expect the price of wild Pacific salmon to rise in the future as an inconsistently controlled, and steadily growing, worldwide human population competes for the privilege of buying this delicacy.

PREPARATION

Before we get to preparing SeaBear salmon for the table, let's start off with a contrasting comparison to a different, more Continental way of preparing cooked salmon.  We'll use farmed Atlantic salmon and add an East-meets-West twist.

A friend of mine lightly spices fresh Atlantic salmon fillets with small amounts of garlic powder, onion powder, and a bit of very finely ground pepper.  After a half hour of dwell time to let the spices soak into the surface, they are then briefly baked for a quarter hour, resulting in barely, but consistently cooked through, soft, flaky, moist salmon.  Nowhere near overcooked, yet not raw anywhere either.  The flavor and taste is so mild, creamy, and naturally well-oiled, that it can be easily forgiven if you close your eyes for a moment, and without any visual cues, find yourself wondering if you are actually eating tender shellfish drenched in butter.

If there is anything to critique about fresh Atlantic salmon prepared this way, it is that they must be presented with only the mildest flavored of accompaniments.  Otherwise the fine taste would be drowned out by the side dishes.

The SeaBear wild Pacific hot-smoked salmon on the other hand is nowhere near as delicate.  You can crank up the flavor on the side dishes and add a fair bit of spice to them without losing the taste of the salmon.  You can get into cheeses, casseroles, and a fair bit saltier fare, and even more flavorful stuff without concern - the SeaBear salmon will hang right in there and still be tasty.  The SeaBear salmon itself is fully flavored from the smoking process and needs no spices, although I do like to add a touch of very coarsely ground pepper for a bit of extra kick here and there.

For the more gastronomically adventurous, don't get ridiculous and expect it to taste like beef jerky, jalapeno hot-sauced chicken wings, or an uncooked side of salted cod.  It is a smooth, nicely smoked, fully-cooked, meaty, flaky, juicy, salmon.  It has a medium-strong flavor, largely imparted by the alder wood that it is cooked with, combined with the natural strength of the Pacific salmon flavor.  It tastes like fish... a very good fish.

SeaBear hot-smoked salmon is super-easy to prepare: open the package, drain the juice (retain the juice if desired), then slide the salmon onto the presentation dish.  Add juice, salt, pepper, and garnish as desired.  It is vacuum packed and the shelf life is years.

If I want to add some salmon to spark up scrambled eggs or another such dish, I reach for the leftover (if any) SeaBear hot-smoked Pacific salmon in the fridge.  It would be futile to reach for the too finely flavored fresh-baked Atlantic salmon - the flavor wouldn't come through.

SO MANY VARIETIES OF PACIFIC SALMON, WHICH ONE IS WHICH?

There are five Northwest Pacific salmon varieties.  All are available as commercially caught wild fish.

- Chinook Salmon is the king of all Pacific salmons and is the largest, so it is often marketed as King Salmon.  It has very large fillets and flakes, and the highest oil content.  When smoked it takes on less smoke flavor and tastes milder.  It is expensive.  Surprisingly, several friends and I don't prefer it.

- Sockeye Salmon is large, has large fillets and flakes, the reddest pink meat, and plenty of oil.  Some folks I know prefer this one.

- Coho Salmon is a middling variety that I have just gotten into the pantry and will try soon.

- Keta Salmon is actually now a new marketing name for an old dog of a product.  The name ""Keta"" derives from the second word of the scientific name Oncorhynchus Keta, but this salmon is really most commonly called Chum Salmon (because it was once commonly ground up for chum and bait when fishing for other species).  Previously it was also commonly known as Dog Salmon (it was used to feed sled dogs).  More recently it has also been marketed as Silverbrite Salmon, which is another ruse to tart up the marketability of the product (all salmon are bright silver during the sea-run phase of their life).  Keta / Chum Salmon is a very large fish, and in spite of the marketing games with the name, I ordered this product expecting to get Keta Salmon, but got Pink Salmon instead.

Pink Salmon is the smallest fish with the smallest fillets and smallest flakes... and it's cheap and plentiful.  Pink Salmon has a not so stellar reputation as the runt of the litter, but properly cooked it is quite nice.  SeaBear has a knack for it.  Several friends and I tried a 3-Pack including Pink, Sockeye, and King Salmon - most preferred the Pink Salmon.  This is mostly a testament to SeaBear's process, because Pink Salmon is usually the cheapest variety of Salmon.

SO WHAT DID SEABEAR / AMAZON SHIP?

Pink salmon, not Keta salmon.

The photos showing the back of the package are correct, and correctly indicate that the currently shipping product is Pink Salmon.

The detail of the Amazon listing says Keta salmon, but that isn't shipping anymore (I'm wondering how many of the negative reviews here were for the Keta Salmon version and how many were for the Pink Salmon version).

WHAT TO BUY?

If (like me) you aren't a very experienced salmon buyer, then it is worth knowing that the similarities between the SeaBear varieties of hot-smoked salmon are many, and the differences are few.  Some have larger or smaller flakes of meat, more or less oil, etc.  But, for the most part, novices often remark to me that the taste is largely the same between the salmon varieties.  This is an assessment that I pretty much agree with (at least as far as the SeaBear hot-smoked King, Sockeye, and Pink Salmon go - I've yet to try the Coho and Keta porducts).

So if you want to try it out, then I don't think it is at all wrong to buy the cheapest or most convenient readily available SeaBear hot-smoked salmon product.  Only if you like the overall SeaBear hot-smoked salmon taste would I then recommend spending the big bucks to try the finer grades.  Even then, like me and several of my friends, you may find yourself preferring a cheaper variety of salmon anyway.  So I would recommend the very economical sampler 3-packs that let you try smaller portions of different varieties to try to find which you like best.

I have some Coho in to try next, and I might yet try to get some Keta in to sample that too.

CONCLUSION

For the finest, lightest tasting salmon experiences, buy fresh if you can.

For a stronger flavor and more pizzaz, I like the various SeaBear hot-smoked salmon products.  They are a flavorful contrast to the mildness of fresh baked salmon.  This Pink Salmon variety was one of my previous favorites.  If I don't post back later saying otherwise, then it is fair to assume that I liked the latest batch just as much as the previous batches.

2689,4,True,1418342400,"Ever since discovering Alton Brown's simple but super healthy recipe for ventresca tuna salad recently, it's become a staple meal I've made for myself over and over and over. (Never tried it? Google it. You'll love it!) So I'm starting to really be able to distinguish the nuances of different types of tuna.

I have made this salad with cheap skipjack tuna in water (Trader Joe's version of light chunk), albacore tuna in oil (also from TJ), Ortiz Bonito Del Norte White Tuna In Olive Oil purchased on Amazon, and finally the Tonnino Ventresca in olive oil.

Albacore tuna - driest of the bunch. I've actually never been a fan of canned albacore due to this reason and have always preferred light chunk. (Alton Brown does have another tuna recipe that uses albacore and it is good for that one.)

Skipjack (light chunk) - it doesn't have the chunky texture as the other tunas, but it's the cheapest and also has the least amount of mercury since skipjack tuna is considerably smaller than the tunas used for albacore and I imagine the other types. Since I eat tuna salad so often, I do have to watch out for mercury content so skipjack is usually my go-to tuna for this recipe. Since it is packed in water rather than oil, I just drain the water and then pour a whole ton of high grade EVOO into the can and mix it in the with the tuna, letting it sit for a few minutes to soak through. This makes a very big difference in flavor and moisture. Since skipjack is also the cheapest tuna, it's a win-win.

Ortiz white tuna - this isn't labeled ventresca, so I'm assuming it's not since Ortiz does have another version of tuna that is labeled as such. But it's still a very expensive tuna and my first foray into high-end canned tuna. VERY GOOD! My boyfriend took one bite of his salad containing this tuna and his first words were, ""This is good tuna!""  Even the tuna-ish oil is good.  We had some left over and I saved it for my next salad because it seemed like such a shame to throw out such flavorful oil.  Now, is it so much better than cheap store-bought tuna to be worth the price? That's subjective. I will say it is noticeably better in flavor than albacore tuna. Maybe around a 40%-50% improvement. For me, it's something I would be willing to pay for once in a while.

Tonnino ventresca tuna - I just had a salad with this tuna and found it disappointing after hearing all the raves about ventresca tuna. Had I not known it was ventresca, I think I would have just assumed I was eating regular albacore, except the chunks were larger, more moist, and saltier. I think it's over-salted. Not too salty but more salty than a good quality tuna needs to be. There wasn't much more flavor to me than salt and the usual tuna flavor you'd expect. If the Ortiz was a 40% improvement over regular canned albacore, the Tonnino is less than 10% and definitely not worth the price to me. The bulk package was cheaper than the Ortiz, but if I'm going to spend the extra money for high-end ""canned"" tuna, then I'd rather go all out and buy the Ortiz next time instead of this one.

I wouldn't say the Ortiz white tuna is THAT different than regular store-bought tuna, so some will undoubtedly feel it isn't worth the 2-3x price increase.  I think of it like a fine wine (although I don't actually drink wine).  Some will appreciate the fine nuances more than others.  Had I grown up eating expensive tuna, I'm sure I would notice a huge degrade in quality when eating cheap store-bought.  But since the opposite is the case, I wouldn't say the difference is explosive.

2718,4,True,1418342400,"Ever since discovering Alton Brown's simple but super healthy recipe for ventresca tuna salad recently, it's become a staple meal I've made for myself over and over and over. (Never tried it? Google it. You'll love it!) So I'm starting to really be able to distinguish the nuances of different types of tuna.

I have made this salad with cheap skipjack tuna in water (Trader Joe's version of light chunk), albacore tuna in oil (also from TJ), Ortiz Bonito Del Norte White Tuna In Olive Oil purchased on Amazon, and finally the Tonnino Ventresca in olive oil.

Albacore tuna - driest of the bunch. I've actually never been a fan of canned albacore due to this reason and have always preferred light chunk. (Alton Brown does have another tuna recipe that uses albacore and it is good for that one.)

Skipjack (light chunk) - it doesn't have the chunky texture as the other tunas, but it's the cheapest and also has the least amount of mercury since skipjack tuna is considerably smaller than the tunas used for albacore and I imagine the other types. Since I eat tuna salad so often, I do have to watch out for mercury content so skipjack is usually my go-to tuna for this recipe. Since it is packed in water rather than oil, I just drain the water and then pour a whole ton of high grade EVOO into the can and mix it in the with the tuna, letting it sit for a few minutes to soak through. This makes a very big difference in flavor and moisture. Since skipjack is also the cheapest tuna, it's a win-win.

Ortiz white tuna - this isn't labeled ventresca, so I'm assuming it's not since Ortiz does have another version of tuna that is labeled as such. But it's still a very expensive tuna and my first foray into high-end canned tuna. VERY GOOD! My boyfriend took one bite of his salad containing this tuna and his first words were, ""This is good tuna!""  Even the tuna-ish oil is good.  We had some left over and I saved it for my next salad because it seemed like such a shame to throw out such flavorful oil.  Now, is it so much better than cheap store-bought tuna to be worth the price? That's subjective. I will say it is noticeably better in flavor than albacore tuna. Maybe around a 40%-50% improvement. For me, it's something I would be willing to pay for once in a while.

Tonnino ventresca tuna - I just had a salad with this tuna and found it disappointing after hearing all the raves about ventresca tuna. Had I not known it was ventresca, I think I would have just assumed I was eating regular albacore, except the chunks were larger, more moist, and saltier. I think it's over-salted. Not too salty but more salty than a good quality tuna needs to be. There wasn't much more flavor to me than salt and the usual tuna flavor you'd expect. If the Ortiz was a 40% improvement over regular canned albacore, the Tonnino is less than 10% and definitely not worth the price to me. The bulk package was cheaper than the Ortiz, but if I'm going to spend the extra money for high-end ""canned"" tuna, then I'd rather go all out and buy the Ortiz next time instead of this one.

I wouldn't say the Ortiz white tuna is THAT different than regular store-bought tuna, so some will undoubtedly feel it isn't worth the 2-3x price increase.  I think of it like a fine wine (although I don't actually drink wine).  Some will appreciate the fine nuances more than others.  Had I grown up eating expensive tuna, I'm sure I would notice a huge degrade in quality when eating cheap store-bought.  But since the opposite is the case, I wouldn't say the difference is explosive.  It is enough though to garner positive comments from most people trying it for the first time.",Delicious,B000VR8ZBS,Tuna Fish,"Ortiz Bonito Del Norte - White Tuna in Olive Oil, 3.95 Ounce Tin",0.9976619,1

2899,4,True,1295740800,"I have used this Chicken of the Sea smoked salmon for my pasta dish and I found it to be satisfactory. It is not to my gourmet standard but it is decent food. The salmon is drier than the refrigerated smoked salmon you get at the local grocery store. Whether it is saltier than the one at grocery store could have been affected by the fact it is drier than normal. My suggestion for the use of this salmon is that it should be used for adding to pasta or to a dish. I think it is a little bit too dry for sandwich or for bagel and lox.

I think it is good to keep a stash of this for emergency food as it can be kept at room temperature and I plan to use it for camping.

Here is my recipe for the salmon dish I made last night. I cooked pasta according to instruction and drained. Added Extra Virgin Olive Oil to the drained pasta. Added two packages of the Chicken of the Sea Smoked Salmon and then add freshly ground lemon pepper spices and grated Parmesan Cheese. For healthier kick, I did add oat germ to the dish. It adds similar texture to the Parmesan cheese with a little oatey nutty flavor. The great benefit is that I added extra fiber and extra cholesterol lowering kick to the dish.

2900,5,False,1282003200,"THE GOOD:
The salmon is a decent sized piece of salmon, heat smoked, and salted.  Every package I've eaten has been tender and flavorful.  The salmon can serve as something in dips, roll-ups, with cream cheese and crackers or cucumber slices . . . and it can be the center attraction in a green vegetable salad or warmed and served with potatoes or rice.

THE PROBLEMATIC:
Several reviewers mention the salty flavor.  In my experience, the salt is very strong in the liquid inside the pouch but not so strong in the salmon itself.  I've used the liquid in salad dressing and dips, but unless you like it salty, don't use all the liquid.  Comparing the sodium content of the smoked and non-smoked products (you have to adjust the listed amounts because for some reason the nutrition listings use 2 oz. serving for one and 3 oz. serving for the other) reveals that the difference is approximately 46 grams--or 1/5th more--for the smoked; perhaps the smoky aspect makes the salt taste stronger.

I was very disappointed in this product as I had wanted it to go with cream cheese and
water crackers, or just as a snack by itself.  The taste is like canned salmon except drier.

The salmon is drier than the refrigerated smoked salmon you get at the local grocery store. Whether it is saltier than the one at grocery store could have been affected by the fact it is drier than normal. My suggestion for the use of this salmon is that it should be used for adding to pasta or to a dish. I think it is a little bit too dry for sandwich or for bagel and lox.

I think it is good to keep a stash of this for emergency food as it can be kept at room temperature and I plan to use it for camping.

Here is my recipe for the salmon dish I made last night. I cooked pasta according to instruction and drained. Added Extra Virgin Olive Oil to the drained pasta. Added two packages of the Chicken of the Sea Smoked Salmon and then add freshly ground lemon pepper spices and grated Parmesan Cheese. For healthier kick, I did add oat germ to the dish. It adds similar texture to the Parmesan cheese with a little oatey nutty flavor. The great benefit is that I added extra fiber and extra cholesterol lowering kick to the dish.

2958,5,False,1282003200,"THE GOOD:
The salmon is a decent sized piece of salmon, heat smoked, and salted.  Every package I've eaten has been tender and flavorful.  The salmon can serve as something in dips, roll-ups, with cream cheese and crackers or cucumber slices . . . and it can be the center attraction in a green vegetable salad or warmed and served with potatoes or rice.

THE PROBLEMATIC:
Several reviewers mention the salty flavor.  In my experience, the salt is very strong in the liquid inside the pouch but not so strong in the salmon itself.  I've used the liquid in salad dressing and dips, but unless you like it salty, don't use all the liquid.  Comparing the sodium content of the smoked and non-smoked products (you have to adjust the listed amounts because for some reason the nutrition listings use 2 oz. serving for one and 3 oz. serving for the other) reveals that the difference is approximately 46 grams--or 1/5th more--for the smoked; perhaps the smoky aspect makes the salt taste stronger.

3267,4,True,1406246400,"Sometimes there are fewer sardines in the can and more olive oil.  I guess this wouldn't be entirely bad, except I can't think of what to do with the sardine tasting olive oil and I throw it out.  A little higher quality control would make this a better product and would have earned it five stars.

I wonder which costs the manufacturer more, sardines or olive oil?  I can understand there being fewer sardines in the can if the fish costs more than the olive oil.  Or, if the olive oil costs more than the fish, then it would be costing the manufacturer more to put fewer sardines in the can.  In this case we must conclude that the sardines and the olive oil must cost the same amount.  But, maybe there is a third expense like the cost of maintaining a high standard of quality control.  In this case we must conclude that the cost of higher quality control exceeds the cost differential between sardines and olive oil.  From macroeconomics we can assume a 2% annual gain in global manufacturing efficiency.  With this in mind we can conclude that the relative increasing cost of labor in time would make quality control relatively more expensive, and that the quality of this product would eventually go down to three stars.  On the other hand, if there would be a way to automate the quality control to guarantee the number of sardines in the can in time this could increase the number of stars that this product would receive.  If these two functions were plotted on the same graph an average could be made to determine the overall trend...

The reason I consider it a fair comparison is, they are both Moroccan sardines (not brislings) packed in olive oil. And, as mentioned, I consider them to be of comparable quality and flavor.

The reason I prefer THESE sardines is:

Value:  you get a 4.375 oz. quantity which is about 1/2 oz. more than the Crown Prince comparable product.  However, on a per can and per ounce basis you pay less for the Cento.  And you get more fish and less oil.  Better price and quantity for similar quality in my view.  In fairness, you get bigger pieces of fish with the Crown Prince product, but you only get 3 pieces and more oil.  With this product you will find the can is jammed with fish.  At least, this has been my experience.

Convenience:  If you eat sardines regularly like I do, the 25 can shipment is more convenient.  Also, these cans are really easy to open and drain.  Note the pull tab location and shape of the can.

I guess this wouldn't be entirely bad, except I can't think of what to do with the sardine tasting olive oil and I throw it out.  A little higher quality control would make this a better product and would have earned it five stars.

I wonder which costs the manufacturer more, sardines or olive oil?  I can understand there being fewer sardines in the can if the fish costs more than the olive oil.  Or, if the olive oil costs more than the fish, then it would be costing the manufacturer more to put fewer sardines in the can.  In this case we must conclude that the sardines and the olive oil must cost the same amount.  But, maybe there is a third expense like the cost of maintaining a high standard of quality control.  In this case we must conclude that the cost of higher quality control exceeds the cost differential between sardines and olive oil.  From macroeconomics we can assume a 2% annual gain in global manufacturing efficiency.  With this in mind we can conclude that the relative increasing cost of labor in time would make quality control relatively more expensive, and that the quality of this product would eventually go down to three stars.  On the other hand, if there would be a way to automate the quality control to guarantee the number of sardines in the can in time this could increase the number of stars that this product would receive.  If these two functions were plotted on the same graph an average could be made to determine the overall trend...

The fish are packed tight in the cans which you rarely see anymore. They are skinless and ""boneless"". I saw some very fine bones but they were never noticed while eating.

They kept breaking. The oil was very clean which was also nice to see.

Those are really good sardines, and I have no intention hear of disparaging that product.  I was subscribed to that product.  If you like those, I think you will find these to be comparable.  The reason I consider it a fair comparison is, they are both Moroccan sardines (not brislings) packed in olive oil. And, as mentioned, I consider them to be of comparable quality and flavor.

The reason I prefer THESE sardines is:

Value:  you get a 4.375 oz. quantity which is about 1/2 oz. more than the Crown Prince comparable product.  However, on a per can and per ounce basis you pay less for the Cento.  And you get more fish and less oil.  Better price and quantity for similar quality in my view.  In fairness, you get bigger pieces of fish with the Crown Prince product, but you only get 3 pieces and more oil.  With this product you will find the can is jammed with fish.  At least, this has been my experience.

Convenience:  If you eat sardines regularly like I do, the 25 can shipment is more convenient.  Also, these cans are really easy to open and drain.  Note the pull tab location and shape of the can.  The Crown Prince flatter/wider cans with pull tab near corner are not as easy to open and drain.","Value, Quality, Flavor",B0014H18L8,Sardines,"Cento Skinless &amp; Boneless Sardines in Olive Oil, 4.375-Ounce Tins (Pack of 25)",0.9974844,1

If you know the show, you'll understand, they stock the finest ingredients from all over the world. Along with whole, fresh tuna, there were several canned varieties, this being one of them. I actually tried all the brands featured on the show, along with a few others that my Amazon search guided me towards. This was BY FAR the best. The consistency is different than any tuna I've eaten. It's much more delicate in texture. Very tender. However, the flavor packs a punch due, in part, to the salt. **WARNING** if you do not enjoy salty foods, this is not the tuna for you!! I can not stress that strongly enough. It was definitely the saltiest tasting tuna I've ever had. I can see how that might be a deterrent for some. I love salty foods so this was perfection for me. The olive oil was rich, fruity and flavorful which added a nice balance to the salt.

Definitely a great, quick lunch which will fill you up but not weigh you down. I drain a little of the oil off and eat it straight out of the can. Throw one in your purse, gym bag or briefcase and you're good to go!

3481,5,False,1313107200,"I'm giving Cento tuna 5 stars not because it's the best canned tuna I've ever had, but because for its price level, it's very good.  Tuna in olive oil tastes different and has a different texture from tuna in water.  And Cento and Progresso taste different from Starkist in olive oil (the most widely available olive-oil brand).  This is a dense tuna-y can of fish with a pleasant flavor and aroma, most closely resembling Progresso tuna.  It does not have the buttery, delicate-but-intense characteristics of the higher price level (e.g. Ortiz Spanish tuna).  It makes a nice salad Nicoise, French-style sandwich (tuna, vegetables, olive oil pressed in baguette), or better-than-ordinary tunafish salad.

Grocery stores in my area emphasize the basic and the inexpensive, and there are no gourmet shops or Italian markets; no one carries this locally.  I buy it when I visit family elsewhere.  There, in a big chain grocery store, it's $2.99/can (5 oz.).  Amazon's price today, as I write this review, is about $2.80/can shipped to your door.

If you know the show, you'll understand, they stock the finest ingredients from all over the world. Along with whole, fresh tuna, there were several canned varieties, this being one of them. I actually tried all the brands featured on the show, along with a few others that my Amazon search guided me towards. This was BY FAR the best. The consistency is different than any tuna I've eaten. It's much more delicate in texture. Very tender. However, the flavor packs a punch due, in part, to the salt. **WARNING** if you do not enjoy salty foods, this is not the tuna for you!! I can not stress that strongly enough. It was definitely the saltiest tasting tuna I've ever had. I can see how that might be a deterrent for some. I love salty foods so this was perfection for me. The olive oil was rich, fruity and flavorful which added a nice balance to the salt.

Definitely a great, quick lunch which will fill you up but not weigh you down. I drain a little of the oil off and eat it straight out of the can. Throw one in your purse, gym bag or briefcase and you're good to go!

3534,5,False,1313107200,"I'm giving Cento tuna 5 stars not because it's the best canned tuna I've ever had, but because for its price level, it's very good.  Tuna in olive oil tastes different and has a different texture from tuna in water.  And Cento and Progresso taste different from Starkist in olive oil (the most widely available olive-oil brand).  This is a dense tuna-y can of fish with a pleasant flavor and aroma, most closely resembling Progresso tuna.  It does not have the buttery, delicate-but-intense characteristics of the higher price level (e.g. Ortiz Spanish tuna).  It makes a nice salad Nicoise, French-style sandwich (tuna, vegetables, olive oil pressed in baguette), or better-than-ordinary tunafish salad.

Grocery stores in my area emphasize the basic and the inexpensive, and there are no gourmet shops or Italian markets; no one carries this locally.  I buy it when I visit family elsewhere.  There, in a big chain grocery store, it's $2.99/can (5 oz.).  Amazon's price today, as I write this review, is about $2.80/can shipped to your door.

As you can see from the difference between the photo on the box, and what is inside, it is not a bright, fresh meal, but an oily over-cooked soggy one.
As oily as the whole thing is, the tuna is hard and dry, not sure how they manage that.
The dog initially expressed interest, but when I put it down he walked away after one sniff.
No flavor, other than oil, and the typical unpleasant taste of canned vegetables. I don't know what their ""Optimal Food Process"" is, but the canned vegetables still taste canned.
Each can is TWO servings, but, in its defense, that still only amounts to 240 calories.
If this is what the French are eating, this explains why French women are so thin. ;)
Thought I could toss this into my bag to eat healthy while an adjunct-on-the-go. The only thing healthy about it would be that I would NOT be able to eat it, so would cut calories through lack of consumption.
My friends would describe me as a foodie, so maybe that's a thing, and I do admit that I simply cannot eat a meal that is yucky. I'd rather go hungry.
I love love love tuna of any kind though, which includes canned, so I would, having tried this, simply pack myself a can of some nice tuna and eat it straight up.
A bummer, too, that you must buy an expensive 6-pack to try this. Green vegetables should not be khaki-colored. Pasta should not be one gentle bite away from turning into mush in your mouth, unless you are under 12 months old. In fact, I guess the nutrition is okay, so maybe you could use this as baby-food in a pinch?
Tuna is the first ingredient, but it took some deep digging to find it, as you can see from my photos.
Dolphin-safe because you won't buy it more than once, so the dolphins needn't fear the St. Dalfour net!

I was a bit hesitant to try this because I am not very fond of fish. I do normally like tuna, if it's not that fishy, but then again I normally would eat it as tuna salad mixed with onions and mayo which would cut the fishy-ness somewhat.

The tuna in this treat is AWESOME! It's nice big chunks of firm tuna that wasn't fishy to me at all! GREAT PRODUCT!!! I did, however, not get any dressing in mine, which I am disappointed about. I bet it would have even been better with that!

No it's not as good as making fresh hot food, but for coming out of a can, I think it's pretty good! An added bonus is that it's not loaded with sodium; one can has around 600mg of sodium which is not bad at all for well, coming out of a can.

For the price (~$3/can) I think it's great. I love to cook so I rarely ever eat anything out of a can like this, and pretty much avoid any canned or packaged 'meal' because it's usually loaded with sodium and fat. Not this. I also tried the salmon with vegetables and honestly, I don't really care for it. This tuna one is much better. I see some people are complaining about the amount of tuna in these.. To me, the portion is acceptable for $3. You're PAYING for the convenience so it's probably not going to be chock full of tuna.

I'm pretty pleased. I eat a lot but try to eat at least 4-5 meals and make them a little smaller, and I use this as my last late night meal before bed. Perfect portion.

As you can see from the difference between the photo on the box, and what is inside, it is not a bright, fresh meal, but an oily over-cooked soggy one.
As oily as the whole thing is, the tuna is hard and dry, not sure how they manage that.
The dog initially expressed interest, but when I put it down he walked away after one sniff.
No flavor, other than oil, and the typical unpleasant taste of canned vegetables. I don't know what their ""Optimal Food Process"" is, but the canned vegetables still taste canned.
Each can is TWO servings, but, in its defense, that still only amounts to 240 calories.
If this is what the French are eating, this explains why French women are so thin. ;)
Thought I could toss this into my bag to eat healthy while an adjunct-on-the-go. The only thing healthy about it would be that I would NOT be able to eat it, so would cut calories through lack of consumption.
My friends would describe me as a foodie, so maybe that's a thing, and I do admit that I simply cannot eat a meal that is yucky. I'd rather go hungry.
I love love love tuna of any kind though, which includes canned, so I would, having tried this, simply pack myself a can of some nice tuna and eat it straight up.
A bummer, too, that you must buy an expensive 6-pack to try this. Green vegetables should not be khaki-colored. Pasta should not be one gentle bite away from turning into mush in your mouth, unless you are under 12 months old. In fact, I guess the nutrition is okay, so maybe you could use this as baby-food in a pinch?
Tuna is the first ingredient, but it took some deep digging to find it, as you can see from my photos.

3671,5,True,1325980800,"UPDATE: two years later, this is still some of the best salmon I've ever had.  I eat it weekly.  It's far better than most fresh store-bought salmon (most of which is ""Atlantic"" which means farmed rather than wild-caught).  One thing I've discovered is that, while this is delicious straight from the bag at room temperature, it's even better if you run the sealed bag under hot water for a minute or so before eating it.  That really brings out the flavor, and helps the delicious natural oil to mix in with the meat.

Original review:

I wasn't sure what this salmon would be like.  I saw it recommended on a site listing portable paleo-friendly food, so I gave it a try.  I love salmon, but only just started eating it last year, and have only ever had it fresh and cooked and hot.

Well, this SeaBear salmon is delicious!  I'd say the smoky/salty flavor is a bit strong, but in a good way.  It does contain some sugar (2g) but doesn't taste very sweet, thankfully.

The package is so thin/flat that it's nearly two-dimensional, so I was kinda expecting to open it and find a flattened pasty mess, but actually the appearance isn't bad, and there were many large whole chunks of meat.

Besides preparing in advance to meet the dangers of wind and water, we must prepare to face brutal heat, lack of electrical power, lack of clean water, and food shortages.  What can we buy that will not spoil?

At the suggestion of a safety director, I first tried SeaBear Ready-To-Eat Smoked Sockeye Salmon this year, and I love it!

SeaBear Ready-to-Eat Sockeye Salmon was recommended to me as a ""hurricane survival food"" with a shelflife of about 4 years.  Of course, it is routinely sold to the rest of the world as a delicacy -- and it is.  I now eat this ready-to_eat salmon about once a month or so as a treat (with Triscuits or mixed with a little mayo and celery as a salad).

It should be mentioned that the salmon comes out of the packet looking pretty much like raw smoked fish -- not like the highly perishable, ""sleek-looking"" salmon that one sees at expensive breakfast buffets.  (By the way, this kind of salmon can be bought at the SeaBear website.) It doesn't look like canned commercial salmon from the grocery store, either -- not pale pink.  It is a moist, red or dark-red, rich, smoked salmon that looks very ""authentic.""  The texture is firm, moderately oily, and perfectly seasoned with a smoky taste that is not overpowering.  You should experiment with this salmon before serving to guests to be sure that you like the appearance.

Since eating too much smoked food is not recommended, I limit my portions when I am not concerned about storms.  At the SeaBear site, you can buy different kinds of salmon and other products, and perhaps they offer salmon that hasn't been smoked, as well.

I thought it was maybe just a bad batch but over time it has proven to be either a new formulation or maybe just a less fatty part of the tuna being used.  It is also clear that Natural Value is fraudulently claiming  AAFCO compliance in their formulation.  Under pressure from  misguided pet owners and Internet cranks this manufacturer removed menadione from their fish based formulations. AFFCO requires the use of vitamin K3 (menadione) in any cat food product containing greater than 25% fish on a dry matter basis, and for good reason. I have labels from previous and new cans and the new ones clearly do not list the required vitamin K supplementation.  So, Natural Value is either lying about the actual ingredients or about the AAFCO label statement.  In either case, I can't trust this company anymore.  I used to buy their cat food by the case at Whole Foods.  If your cat happens to like this product, I think it would be OK only as a treat (since it does have a great basic ingredients list), definitely not as a regular entire meal.

3825,3,True,1413504000,"I love shrimp in general however the steep price together with quality issues make it difficult for me to find a good one; so I am always searching for a good deal. I try to avoid any sort of farmed seafood, due to the fact that they contain a lot more artificial chemicals or pollutants compared to wild caught ones and are also not as nutritious either. However, the wild caught ones are generally much more expensive and less frequently found in stores.

On top of this, if you decide to buy canned or frozen, then processing becomes an issue. Most of the time manufacturers add some phosphate compounds and claim it is to retain freshness ( a less nasty word than preservatives) but these compounds are known to have detrimental effects on nature and many claimed effects on health and therefore they are out of question too. Whren it comes to canned food, there is a BPA (endocrine disturbing agent) issue as well. To get a wild caught and phosphate free seafood supplied in BPA free cans, you need to not only pay a high cost but also look around for a long time. I was happy to find this product on amazon which was both phosphate free and wild caught and additionally, sustainably caught and offered in a BPA free can. Besides, the price, after subscribe and save savings, was making it even a better deal than those offered in local stores.

I ordered a 12 pack and have tried 3-4 of them in different cuisines but the taste, unfortunately, is far from being satisfactory which changes the whole picture. They are so small that any dish you put, they immediately dissolve. For salads and other raw servings, they might be better than hot dishes but again the taste is nowhere near pleasant. No matter what I added (sauces and stuff) I could not get any joy with those meals.

It is very unlikely that I will order them again. This company does a great job by offering a way healthier and environment consciuous product but they should go back and check their product because without a good flavor, the rest is not just good enough for most costumers including me.

Finally, I have to make a note that taste is a subjective criteria and although some other reviewers commented on its taste with similar complaints, you may find it the opposite way.

3845,4,True,1277510400,"Let me explain that title.  Given how the products are sealed and cooked in the container in their own natural juices, there is as much juice per ounce (allowing for variation in each fish) in both the canned and pouched versions.  However, at least in my experience, the cans keep the meat chunks immersed in the liquid - whereas the pouch allows the juice to pool at the bottom, leaving much of the meat not in contact with it.  I had my pouch laying flat, so it should have kept the meat as moist as possible.  However, the meat seemed quite dry when it came time to eat it.

I still give it four stars because (a) the product is of high quality, (b) I respect the fishing practices of this company, and (c) the meat can be moistened by breaking it up and mixing it around in the juices.  Because I use about one-fourth of the package at a time, the need to figure out how much juice to pour out of the pouch for the meat along with having to break it up and mix it together causes me to remove a star.

What you are getting is a single solid slab of tuna measuring approx. 6 inches wide 9 inches long and 1 inch thick. 2 whole pounds of Wild Planet's low mercury wild caught tuna. As you can see from the reviews of their canned Tuna this really is a very delicious Tuna and they cook it right in the aluminum type pouch that it comes in. When you open the pouch the juices from that cooking are evident. I know many of you probably have bought fresh Tuna in the fish market and find canned Tuna of no comparison. I, myself have only done that once and it turned out very dry and leathery when broiled. I don't know how to compare a Tuna loin like this to a fresh cooked piece of Tuna but if you don't have access to fresh tuna or just want a high quality Tuna for sandwiches or other dishes I truly don't know where you could find a higher quality and certainly more economical piece of fish. This truly is a novel idea whose time has come. Taking a large, fresh piece of fish and putting it in a sealed pouch and cooking it. It is the next best thing to fresh fish, especially when your favorite fish is not in season or available frozen.
I wish someone would package Sockeye Salmon like this. The only ingredients in this product are Tuna and sea salt. None of the extenders etc.. in commercial store bought Tuna. Now, Wild Planet's new can's of Tuna are 5 ounces, so you would have to buy 6 1/3 cans to equal this 2 lb. pouch. A cost of $27.00 verses $16.00. So you can see it certainly is a better bargin.

Eating healthy is expensive, but my husband and I can get at least four meals out of one pouch, so when you think of it that way, it's not so pricey.

This tuna tastes better than any of the canned stuff (with or without broth) that I was buying at the local supermarket.

My first thought was that it tastes ""fancy"" like it came from a deli. My finicky husband loves it!

The fish remains ""moist"" but not wet like the canned kind. If you squeeze out the water of canned tuna anyway, this is already done for you, basically. And, the foil pouch is infinitely easier to deal with than opening several sharp-edged cans.

As for price... I do not live close to any discount stores and the only brand I was buying (which unfortunately started adding vegetable broth recently) would cost me $7.49 for a four pack.

It's more expensive, but very very good, with real salmon flavor and texture. It truly is skinless and boneless, and in nice big chunks (it's like a big piece of fish in the can, with maybe some smaller chunks to fill the space and weight needs). And being wild-caught, and in BPA-free cans, there's the added assurance that they're good for you!

This would be excellent in a salmon salad, but what I do with it most often is a salmon hash, with sweet potatoes. It's also good mixed into mac & cheese! For those of us who don't have regular reliable sources of fresh wild sockeye this is really a great option.

IMPORTANT NOTE: after the comment here I did further research, and the cans for the salmon are NOT, as of mid-2012, BPA-free (the tuna and sardines are). Sorry for the misinformation; I had seen reports that all of the Wild Planet seafood was BPA-free, but apparently (according to the company) there are no Alaska plants working with BPA-free cans and their other tests to date have not been satisfactory.

Sockeye salmon is very sustainable and healthier to eat than other kinds of salmon.  It cannot be farmed because of its eating habits.  It eats algea and insects, leaving this kind of salmon to be the least carnivorous and lower on the food chain, thus, the lowest in environmental contaminants, such as mercury.

The juice in the can is a superb soup base and all the oysters were whole,

in everything from Chinese dishes to old fashioned oyster stew. I have found
that are delightfully more costly for me than others I have used, not because
they cost more, but because I need to use more cans than usual when I cook
as a result of being unable to resist polishing off a can as I cook as a snack.

Don't drain them! A major unexpected plus is that the
broth is even better than when purchase clam broth alone in the jar. If it does
not go in the soup or sauce, it is great taste treat to drink it. Finally,
they do NOT taste salty, as some can from the cooking process. This is good
since it won't mess up recipes when more salt is added.

production practice. One greivance after another. I'm taking time to calling
them out because it has reached the point of inteferring with my ongoing shopping efforts.

removed. One from some liberal wingnut rated these as poor (one star)

is a mental disorder.

I point out the consistency because I was hoping this would be more of a trail-side snack/ finger-food kind of thing based on the tags reviewers had given it.  It is not jerky.

I have searched the packaging and researched online to see if I could confirm this information but could not find anything which shows the 7.5 oz cans (which require a can opener to open) contain any BPA.  I am hoping the company realized that having BPA on the lid but advertising ""BPA free can"" was wrong and corrected the issue.  I hope they no longer contain BPA, and for now I will assume they don't.",Fantastic product.,B001FA1MHE,Salmon,"Henry &amp; Lisa's Natural Seafood Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon, 6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)",0.9976035,1

I did a side-by-side taste comparison that I posted on my blog at meals4one.com.  I can't link it here, but here's the summary:

I compared these three brands:

- Bumblebee Pink Salmon in water.  $2.49 for a 5oz can (.50/0z)
- Rubinstein's Red Salmon. $4.19 for a 7.5 oz can (.61/0z), and
- Henry & Lisa's. $13.03 for 4 6 oz cans (.54/oz)

First impressions are that the Rubinstein's is a little disgusting looking but improves once I poured off the red liquid.  The bumblebee's looks like a can of tuna fish.

Now for the taste test.

- The Bumblebee salmon is dry and flavorless.  I think to myself that I'm not sure a cat would eat it.
- The Rubenstein's is a little oily and has more flavor.  But the bones and skin aren't too appealing.
- Henry & Lisa's is less oily and has a slightly better flavor.

That night I have a salmon salad with a little ginger sesame salad dressing using Henry and Lisa's salmon.  Tastes great and the salmon is surprisingly filling.  The next day I made enchilada's with the other two cans of Salmon.  And my son's right, with lots of seasoning you could cook with the cheaper brands.

There is no denying how good this salmon is, it's premium wild salmon. But! The quality varies can to can. Which is unfortunate.

For instance:

Can 1: A nice almost single filet with medium chunks.
Can 2: Medium Chunks of fillet with some flakey tiny tiny pieces. Big pieces of struvite.
Can 3 and 4: Like Light tuna like consistency (gross and not warranting this high price), basically like filler. Lots of small struvite particles. Like biting into rocks, glass, crystals, etc.

I decided not to buy this stuff anymore, as I like more of the fillet, or medium size chunks. I got too many cans that were flakey stuff, the same consistency as light tuna is. WAY too expensive for the inconsistant quality. Addressing the struvite, while it is commonly known that it is a mineral and natural, and that it is rare to get...I tend to doubt it...unless I have won the struvite lottery. Conistantly with my order of 4 cans, there are two cans that contain it. Generally the ones that have the flakey filler in the whole can. While most if it is small, I have had what looked like a geode, about .75 inches long, and .5 incles high, fanned out crystal. No way my teeth could crunch it. This is entirely too high for me, and nothing ruins an almost $5 can of salmon like crystals inside.

My theory is that they noticed their salmon had huge struvite particles (Can 2), and started to almost puree the stuff (can 3 and 4) to save from a loss, or to pass the buck the the consumer. Which does not go unnoticed.

This is how I view it and it is my opinion. If it was $2 a can I would buy more, but the supermarket alternatives are less expensive, and while most of those do not have the occasional fillet piece, I feel it is a better value over all. If the quality control was better on these, I would be buying them every week, but consistancy needs a lot of work, and company either needs a better QC supervisor, or to lower the price. The quality does not match what is advertised in the 30 or so cans I have had. You be the judge.

It is superior in terms of taste than most of other brands I tried (from Wholefoods) for two reasons:
- It uses wild Alaskan pink salmon. This type of salmon has higher fat content and is much more tastier than the leaner/dryer sockeye salmon.
- It is canned in its own juice instead of spring water.

I have had the older version (the one w/ attached can opener) for years. The new can does not have opener anymore as of July 2012 at Amazon and Wholefoods. The product picture is outdated.

Ortiz are perfect for directly serving on pizza.

These Portuguese sardines in Portuguese olive oil are plump, about 4 inches (10 cm) in circumference at the widest point, and about as long as the tin. There are three per can. I doubt that the sardines have literally been smoked, as smoke flavor is added. They are delicious, though. I find that the bones are softer and the flesh of the fish a better texture than other brands. I don't know what the company is doing differently, but many sardines are a little dry inside, while Bela sardines are moist and flavorful all the way through. You can eat the bones or remove them easily. They are soft enough that you will probably not notice them, but I'm not convinced they can be digested. Scales probably can't be digested either, but they're imperceptible in the mouth and not easily removed. I've also tried Bela's Sardines in Tomato Sauce.

I just purchased one of each of these sardines in plain olive oil, lemon-flavored olive oil, and the cayenne pepper-flavored olive oil. The lemon-flavored oil was the only one of the three I did not much enjoy, as the lemon flavor is not derived from natural lemons but rather from chemical citric acid, and is sharply synthetically acidic. The cayenne pepper sardines were not bad (they are not spicy at all, but have just a hint of cayenne in the olive oil), but the sardines in plain olive oil were the ones I enjoyed the most. As for this company's sardines themselves...WOW. This is probably my favorite brand of canned sardines right now (with the plain olive oil variety being my favorite). There are 3 large or 4 medium sardines per can, and they are plump, tender, meaty, and very fresh. They are skin-on and do have the thinnest, almost imperceptible scales present, but they are perfectly edible, as is the spine (in fact, both are a good source of calcium, gelatin, silica, and other good things your body makes good use of--in addition to being delicious). Aside from that, the sardines are perfectly cleaned, with one awesome surprise-- sardine ROE! : ) I do not know if this company always catches their sardines just before spawning, or if I just got a fortunate batch (my cans had a Best Before stamp of June 2017), but these were the eggiest sardines I have had, with a plump sliver of roe in each sardine in my three cans (I wonder what happens to the boy sardines?). I usually add sardines to potato salad, or I saute some sliced onions and garlic, then add sardines and some capers with a nice tomato sauce (like TJ's putanesca or arrabiata) and eat with a flat pasta, but I enjoyed each of these three sardine varieties as is, straight from the can, or in a bowl with a squeeze of lemon and a dash of a spicy paprika (I am sure cayenne will do just as nicely).

But after seeing Andrew Zimmern tour the plant in Canada, and reading all the reviews, I decided to shell out the money for 12 cans as a rare treat for myself. I love tuna, and if this lived up to all the hype I figured it would be worth trying. After receiving my small box of gold, I put all 12 cans on the counter and stared for a few minutes. I immediately started to regret the purchase. But, optimistically I decided to pop open a can. The first thing I noticed was the aroma. Nothing like the store bought tuna. Not fishy or oily smelling. More of a fresh, almost chicken like smell. And it wasn't a shredded, watery mush. It was one solid hunk of tuna with very little liquid. After removing it from the can, I used a fork to flake it and mix it with the liquid. Now it looked more like tuna. My first taste was a mixture of surprise and relief. The texture was unbelievable. More like a tuna steak rather than canned tuna. Not that I've led a sheltered life, but I had no idea canned tuna could taste like this. I slowly savored the rest of the can while my cat looked on, impatiently awaiting  her share. Sorry kitty, this is mine. But she did get to lick the can. Relieved, now I could justify the price. Line caught, low mercury, responsibly harvested. What more could one ask from this remarkable tuna. Although I can't afford to buy it on a regular basis, I will buy it as often as I am able.

It is BULGING cans and/or cans with rusty looking seams that you are not supposed to eat. If it looks like the shipping container got wet, just clean the cans first, as you would do after a flood. I am a health inspector in California. Most people don't know that it is NOT even illegal to sell products past the out-date, at least in this state. Those dates are a guideline and we even license stores called Food Salvagers that sell primarily expired goods at a steep discount. Now I wouldn't necessarily eat expired dairy products, except yogurt with live cultures. And some bottled juices will separate after a very long time (way past the out-date), and the main problem with that is texture. Meat, maybe, depends on how it looks and if it's been frozen, but packaged goods are mostly good for a long time after that date. If it smells rancid or stale, then don't eat it. Oddly enough, saltine crackers are one item that gets really rancid eventually, and I'm talking a long time after the listed date. I get mad when I see grocery store personnel dumping wagon loads of food in dumpsters that are past the out-date when they could be donating them to people in need.

Some of my favorites were the french ones, especially those from Brittany, where one can find all manner of little stores with great selections of sardines and other canned fish.

  But these, which I first tasted in Europe, have a special ""steaky"" quality that I love -- dense, chewy texture that is deeply satisfying. Nothing mushy about these -- they may even remind you of a tuna steak.  When you open the can, you will  see  that they are different from what most Americans are used to, as there are usually only three sardines to a can, and are twice as thick as those offered by, say, Bumble Bee. These sardines have power and substance! Eating these is about as close as you'll come to having grilled, fresh sardines in Basque Country with garlic and parsley (I am getting really hungry).

Toast up that baguette, add a squirt of lemon, a dash of salt and pepper, and you've  got all the lunch you could ever want -- especially when hiking or in a hurry. These sardines will never let you down. My wife, who is generally less enthusiastic about sardines than I am, is ready to wolf these.

And of course it is important to remind everyone that these noble fish have a long shelf life. Buy lots of them now and use them to barter for gasoline, ammunition, water filters , propane, and whatever else you may need during the apocalypse/zombie invasion/economic collapse.

The texture is not so firm that they taste like tuna, but not so mushy that the fish do not hold their shape. Despite there being the skin, bones and scales, these don't have a bad fishy after taste - at least by this sardine eater's standards.

While I wouldn't say these are the sardines for non sardine eaters, I'd imagine they'd be pretty good for someone whose trying to work their way up to eating the skin and bones. The closest comparison I've found to other sardines would be Henry and Lisa's sardines. Those fish are a little more firm and not as salty, and while good, they're still some notches below these guys.

(07/08/2017)
What possible update can I have for a case of 25 sardines? Reviewing all 25.

Perhaps this is because I do not eat the skin and bones, even though I know they are edible and, indeed, the bones are good for calcium.  But, I find those parts disagreeable and always remove them. So, these are a lot more work...and greasy, smelly work at that. The flavor is slightly better than those, though. With the boneless, skinless Crown Prince, I realize I am sacrificing a bit of flavor for ease and convenience.

Perhaps fairer is to compare them to the sardines I normally purchase that do have skin and bones.  These MAY, and I am not certain they really do, have a slightly better flavor than the double-layer brisling sardines I also purchase here, Crown Prince 2 Layer Brislings, and those come out to a unit price of $2.28. I really can't say that they are better at all, and certainly not enough as to justify costing double the price.  In fact, if I don't factor in the skin and bones, my taste preference is for the smaller sardines, not the larger ones such as these Matiz sardines.

Finally, the work of removing the skin and bones from these was more than removing the skin and bones from the CP2LB because these have an almost mushy texture and that makes it harder to remove the slimy skin.  One more note, these actually had SCALES on the skin - not something I've ever seen on other canned sardines and, being the large size like the boneless, skinless sardines in my first paragraph, and not the smaller size, the Matiz bones are larger - so, between these two issues - scales and larger bones, I am even less likely to eat them without removing these parts.

I have purchased a few other brands that come in this size with skin and bones, but have yet to try them so I can't compare the Matiz to those.

On the whole, I was disappointed as I expected these to wow me and they did not live up to my expectations.",Didn't live up to expectations.,B001IZ60S2,Sardines,"Matiz Espa&ntilde;a Sardines in Olive Oil, 4.2-Ounce (Pack of 5)",-0.99898463,1

But how do they taste? Great for a canned fish- not as good as fresh- not as firm as some saltier brands.

4599,1,False,1341878400,"I grew up eating Starkist tuna.  It was my favorite above any other brands I tried.  This is not the same tuna it was before.

I noticed a decline in quality for some time.  The tuna had a stronger smell.  There was often nuclear-orange glowing color on top of the tuna.  The size of the cans got smaller.  One can used to yield a few sandwiches.  Now you have to open at least two cans for two people.  When you drain the liquid out, the lid goes so far down because there isn't as much tuna as there used to be.  But that isn't the worst part.

I noticed this year that every can I've opened has had some sort of sludgy gel-like goo surrounding the tuna.  I touched it to see what it was like and it feels like grimy slime.  I wondered if this was a bad batch (we usually buy lots of cans at a time) or some sort of new way they are packing it.  I looked it up and saw others were finding the same thing in their tuna.  I tried eating some of it after getting most of the goo off.  But it did not taste very good.  I now regret eating it at all after reading the following.

Apparently the company was once owned by Del Monte, but was sold to a South Korean tuna company that was hoping to get into the American market.  For what reason?  To poison us?  Seriously, I can't imagine what they put in these cans.  I also read that they refused to provide records to the FDA when asked.  That can't be good.  Why is this stuff still on our store shelves?  Why are American companies selling out to foreign ones all the time?  Americans are finding it harder and harder to afford groceries.  We don't want to spend our money on trash products.  I will never buy Starkist again unless it one day makes its way back to American hands.  There is obviously something wrong with it.  Just look at it and smell it next time you open a can.

Way back in our elementary school days, we used to make four regular sandwiches from a can of tuna; my best guess is that was stretching things, even then, but were those cans not 6.5 ounces rather than 5 ounces?

Two cans, both gross. I had to run out to the local supermarket and grabbed some store brand albacore instead. Before I tossed the Starkist I snapped some photos I'll post when I around to it. You can't get the smell from photos but you can see the clear difference between StarKist and a generic SuperFresh brand.

Another poster commented that StarKist was sold to a Korean company. I looked it up and this happened in 2008 (and Heinz owned Starkist before 2002).

I give it five stars here because, for me, it is the best I've every found in a can.

Only, kippers are made from an oily fish and less oil means somewhat less herring flavor. Plus I also enjoy eating salt cured herring with cheese and crackers.

TASTE= Appel is one of the best kippers in market
MEAT= 196g
MIX= Can separate whole fish from the oil

Fish is my main diet. I try and consume only small fish from reputable sources. No fish from China or Asia, only from Canada, US, Germany and cold Baltic Seas except sardines from Morocco. I am not worried about the added ingredients of tomato sauce, oil, water, etc. since I never consume that part of the can where sodium lingers around plus all additives, I only consume the fish and dump the rest of the mix. I always prefer smoked since the producer has to sell the fish in one piece instead of pieces of fish floating around in juice regardless of the juice type. Fillets are usually sold in some type of tomato juice, water, oil, etc. I never get the chance to taste the real fish which I am after so experience has proven to me to trust smoked more than filet. Filet is always soft and hardly tastes like fish and for that reason always sells less than smoked as well.

My goal is to get the most PROTEIN, CALCIUM and VITAMIN D and B-12 without sacrificing TASTE. No farm raised fish for me, only wild fish. I do not trust what is printed on the Nutrition Facts of the labeling in majority of times since after consuming thousands cans from hundreds of different producers, I have noticed a considerable manipulation of numbers in the NUTRITION FACTS when comparing all those cans time after time. It is obvious to me that there is much misrepresentation especially when it comes to protein on these cans. Canned fish are sold everywhere so prices vary much and Amazon does not have the best prices at all on all since there are many great stores that offer canned fish for unbelievable prices so shoppers need to do their search accordingly. Majority of the canned fish in a flat form shipped by Amazon were shipped to me somehow damaged, bent, cracked open regardless since those cans were not protected properly during shipping due to its weight so remember to have your camera ready.

Smoked sprats from Baltic Seas are the smallest of all only one inch long and I get some 18 sprats in a 4oz cans. Here is the scoop for salmon, herrings and sardines. Sardines, sprat and Alaska salmons offer more calcium since those are complete fish with bones and skin unlike herrings. Herring fillets in mix offer less taste and more additive unlike the smoked herrings which are whole fish with great taste so the extra charge is for the sauce not the fish where I dump anyway so fillets have never made any sense to me. Salmon and sardines offer more protein per calorie but sardines have the most saturated fat per calorie not per serving size. For higher Omega 3 to 6 ratio and vitamin B, I consume Herrings but for high vitamin D and calcium I consume sardines, sprats and Alaskan salmon with bones, skin and all. Check out the comment section of my review for links to other fish with great taste. It is so stupid to purchase farm raised fish which pollute the environment with added carpet dye for coloring before selling it to consumers without any knowledge about farm raised fish practices.

Upon opening a can of a competitor's high end product, I noticed what looked like missing tuna, a large empty area. So, I weighed it and found it was short an ounce! That got me started weighing the contents of every can of tuna I open, no matter the brand. As I've always questioned the statement on these brands that no water has been added, & as I always notice quite a lot of liquid in the cans, when I weighed them, I first poured off the water, weighing it separately. No matter what brand I do this with, I seem to get the same result. The liquid always weighs an ounce. If there were truly no added water, I don't believe this level of consistency in the weight of the liquid would be possible. All of the liquid may not be water. Some of it may be natural juices, but I'm convinced that some water is being added. !f not, then they must be collecting the natural juices separately and then adding them back in at exactly an ounce per can.

Somewhere in the mid seventies quality control began to go downhil or it was the basic economics of producing this product.  This is reminiscent of better days, it's a little pricier and less in the can, so I use less of it and not as often.  I use a whole can for the two of us for the best tuna sandwich, using very little mayo, finely chopped half stalk of celery, about 1/4 of an apple minced finely, a small handful of chopped walnuts and some fresh ground pepper.  Sometimes I'll ad a slice of cheddar and grill it!

When I went to eat my first can, I shook the can and heard water inside. I called the company and told them I hear water sloshing around inside the can when I shake it. The ""ingredients"" label printed on the can does not say ""water""? The woman I spoke to said there is no added water. However, the water in the can comes from the tuna itself, as the Tuna is cooked in the sealed can. Okay, great!...Then, I should not drain and discard  the water as it contains Omega 3''s. So, I eat the Tuna right out of the can and dip it in the flavorful water. Delicious! Great for my vegetarian plant based diet. I look forward to the day the I have scheduled for Skip Jack. I eat one can a week. This Skip Jack tastes quite a bit better than regular tuna. I feel good knowing the Skip Jack is ""pole caught""..

I have read a few negative reviews and wanted to assure everyone that NOTHING has changed w/ Wild Planet except the labeling on the can.... after reading the one negative review, I contact the company (always best to go to the source than risk misinformation.... we have enough of that on the net!).
My case of tuna was received and is just as awesome as it has been for over 10 year that I have been eating it!  ...and yes, this tuna is not canned in the USA... but take a few minuets to try to locate any large scale cannery in the USA (good luck)... there aren't any.  There are a few micro cannery's and you can locate tuna for sale that is canned there but you are going to pay A LOT more for that tuna.

As I said before... NOTHING has changed with the tuna... since Wild Planet is WILD and not farmed raised, there could be variations in fish depending on time of year caught, size of fish, fish diet... and I am sure everyone know this.. After receiving the company info, I feel confident nothing has changed with the tuna... anytime you are eating a wild non-farm raised animal there are going to be differences based on environmental conditions...and everyone also knows our global environment is drastically changing :(

I received an excellent... long and very detailed email from Wild Planet... here are the excerpts regarding product changes:

EMAIL DIRECTLY FROM WILD PLANET:
Thank you for being a long time customer. Our albacore fish, canning method, and cannery have not changed.

We did update all of labels, to make them more eye appealing and added new information, like the non GMO statement. We did remove other information like the BPA statement to comply with California Prop 65. We chose to remove it completely other company will be handling it different. We have not changed our cans, the lining of our cans still do not contain BpA.

We do test our nutrition labels yearly, label changes, a new product line, or when FDA requirement changes. With our new labels we decided to use the current testing nutrition labels. We send a random selection of cans from a production run or runs to our testing facility and they send us back our nutrition facts to use. We usually use one catch or few catches per product run the testing will reflect those catches. The difference can be size of fish, fat content, ocean conditions, etc. If the albacore was caught when they just to fed and build up their fat. Then the can will have more protein and less fat, less omegas. If the catch was caught at the end of the feeding then there would be less protein and more liquid, more omegas. Since we are catch and process throughout the year, the actually can content may differ from the nutrition label. """,Same Wild Planet I have loved for over 10 years....

I like the texture because each can contains a sort of tuna steak. But I think I need to find the kind that has a lighter and less fishy flavor.

The cans were banged up when I received them. This creates the risk of allowing air into the can which I guess would cause food poisoning. I did eat all 12 cans and I'm still alive so I guess that didn't happen

I like the Bumble Bee Prime Fillet Solid White Albacore Tuna In Water which I buy right in the grocery stores. I'd like to find that kind of tuna fish with the same texture as this Wild Planet brand.

The Bumble Bee is pretty good although sometimes the tuna fish is all broken up in some of the cans.

5011,1,True,1454544000,"This is an update. I have been buying this tuna for a long time. Within the last month I have purchased this twice. This last time....

Cans changed label. The canning location changed. The nutritional value on the cans has changed. Cholesterol has gone up, salt went down, Omega3 amounts went down.

Opening a can, the product has changed appearance, texture, and odor. All for the worse. Taste has changed. I tried eating some and I got sick from it, and we had to wash everything that was in contact with it to get rid of the lingering odor.... and take the trash out to be rid of the can. Overall, I don't know what happened but if you get yellow cans (yellow on the label and a yellow bit of art screenprinted onto the can lid, this is the 'new product' which is NOT what the description on here is currently showing!  The can, and nutritional values have changed.

This is no longer the product I strongly recommend and love. I can buy $1 cans of white albacore that taste and smell better now.

Old review below shows you what it USED TO BE. I'm back to looking for something else. Amazon was nice to refund because the description on the site is no longer what the product is (at the time I'm changing this review).

Case box looks small. The label is 'upside down' as the bottom is a poptop. Was surprised to find it is a SOLID chunk of tuna and very little juice. (to get the full omega 3 amount you have to eat the juice too). Very aromatic. Had to sort of pry it out of the can into a bowl and it is very solid and you have to work to break it up. It is also quite dry for a tuna. It is very flavorful, almost too strong by itself. WOW though. I put a little lemon juice on it to moisten it up a bit and added a bit of sriarcha and ground black pepper and ate it plain. The lemon toned it down to my tastebud's preference and helped with the dryness. It is awesome. I ate the bowlful (entire can) to 'cat tongue clean' (just about) and it was totally delicious. I am on restricted carb, cholesterol, sodium and calorie and need omega3 to give my HDL a boost and this also delivered quite a bit of hard protein. (hence I ate a whole can).  225 calories, 250mg sodium, no carbs, 25mg of cholesterol and 65% of my daily protein in 5oz. At about $4 a can it's not cheap but the combination of flavor, low calorie, reasonable sodium, low cholesterol and protein, plus all the omega 3, this is worth it. I hunted for a long time to find something that might fit all my dietary restrictions and this... was well worth the hunt. Forgot to add, BPA free can. Just frosting on the cake :)

edit: Recently went to doctor, and this has definitely hiked my good cholesterol (HDL) and helped with the LDL level. I took a can in with my prescriptions and supplements and seriously said this is what I'm eating as a supplement to boost my omega3 intake. I consider one serving 'one can' and that is an entire meal for my day; and showed him the low cholesterol, fairly low sodium, low calories, and he actually wrote it down to look into to suggest to other patients. That I eat 2-3 times a week.

The amount of juice is small and if you flake up the meat chunk with a fork very seriously, all the juice disappears into the meat and makes it moist and not dry. I have skipped adding lemon juice, add a few spices and eat as is. It is very easy to mix into other foods once you flake it up.

I even saw a few reviews liken the taste of this Wild Planet wild albacore to that of the cheaper supermarket brands- which is, in my opinion, completely ridiculous. Of course, I remind myself, there are a certain percentage of people that cannot be pleased at any cost. It seems the majority of those 6% of reviews are focused on a perception of salt and, since this a ""no-salt added"" product, perhaps some folks don't realize that tuna is a saltwater fish!

I first tried this product after finding a 5 can sleeve (priced at $3 a can) at Costco, I was blown away by the difference in taste! I thought I must be imagining something, so I opened a can of the KS brand, which is certainly better than most-- but, in fact, it was true! Wild Planet was by far the best tasting canned tuna I have ever encountered. Unfortunately, it disappeared from the shelves and has not returned. I guess tuna that's 3x the price of
Starkist isn't for the masses. Regardless, I found it once again in one of the better regional supermarkets the other day ($3.69 per can) and, again, I was equally impressed. I can no longer eat the mainstream brand canned tuna products....it's just not the same thing!

The label DOES state that this wild albacore is small line caught in the waters of the North Pacific and off the coast of New Zealand and it IS canned in Vietnam. If that bothers you, consider looking at Vital Choice, but be prepared to pay close to $6 for an equivalent 5oz portion of albacore.

The tuna is pole and troll caught, which was a plus for me and a reason I would be willing to pay more. But at nearly 3X as much, I was skeptical. Then I read that the tuna is cooked only once, in the can so it retains all it's Omega 3's.....OK, we are moving in the right direction. Something that was worth a bit more in my book.

5151,5,True,1431907200,"Never knowingly had skipjack before, must say I like it much better than albacore by far. Reminds me of how tuna tasted back in the 50's and 60's.

UPDATE: I am reading all kinds of statement in reviews on here lately that don't hold water, the cans I just received in late July still read pole and line caught, no bpa, high omega 3, and Pacific caught, as for the skip jack cans. The radioactivity is no more than any other previous cans I ordered, and the taste is still just as good. I think people are getting to health risk crazy over things in other areas they don't blink an eye about. Like 1 part per million of dead bug debree in cereals, or many other products. People have eaten and lived normal life spans, (for their time) throughout history, eating all kinds of life forms, that we would never consider eating unless it was a matter of life or death. That does not mean that caution shouldn't be the rule, when it comes to toxic materials be it naturally occurring or man made. But I see no sense in worrying to death about this when things like chlorine and fluoride in are municipal drinking water still permeates throughout the U.S. ALONG WITH GROWTH HORMONES AND SYNTHETIC ANTIBIOTICS IN MOST OF OUR MEAT SOURCES ETC. Do as you will but from what I see and test I find no reason to stop buying this as I have been doing.

According to my research, this is the second highest selenium content tuna. That means it is able to eliminate any minute amount of mecury it contains from the body, not allowing it to accumulate.

My radiation gieger mueller counter shows it to be only slightly higher than normal background radiation levels here in eastern Tennessee. (3 to 4 microseverts on a 4 hr average)

So far I have used 9 of 12 cans, tuna salad, tuna melts, tuna/ tomato buds, and antlpasta. Will be re- ordering this product for sure in the near future.

Please do yourself a big favor and invest in a geiger/ mueller counter if your eating/ purchasing west coast seafood of any kind, do not trust the industry to police itself when it comes to radiation levels that the government agencies keep upping so as to not alarm the unwary public as to what is happening to the west coast sealife as a whole.

Wild Planet just tastes so much better than others that I've tried. I generally just dump it in a bowl, mix in a bit of mayo, chop of some veggies and eat it over a bed of spinach. It's become one of my favorite meals, which is pretty funny for me since I always thought I hated tuna.

Anyway, this tuna isn't at all dry, it tastes amazing - I can eat it right out of the can, but the family loves it in tuna salad, or tuna burgers - which my mom made pretty frequently when we were growing up. My family likes real mayo, not the sweet stuff, and my family likes tuna salad with dill relish, not sweet pickle relish. We finish it up with some finely shredded cheddar cheese, and oh it is good!

Growing up my mother made tuna burgers with lots of Miracle Whip, sweet pickle relish, and a nice big slab of Velveeta to top it off! Then she'd cook them in the oven until the bun was a bit crunchy, the Velveeta melted, and the sandwich was hot. Things have changed - we're healthier now, and I can't imagine feeding some of those things to my family, but I have to admit they were tasty!

Along with the healthier changes, finding a tuna I can eat pretty much as often as I want is great - I LOVE tuna, and salmon! It's pricer than big brand tunas, but it tastes so much better!

According to Rob Endelman Wild Planet's tuna is caught off the California coast and processed in Viet Nam because the last large volume processing cannery in the US closed in 2010.  I don't know why American corp aren't investing in canning facilities.  When Fukushima reactor leaked radioactive particles in the Pacific Ocean the contamination found it way along the California coast.  the Bluefin tuna is very contaminated but not the skipjack or albacore.  All fish pass water thru their mouth and gills to stay alive.  Therefore tiny bits of contamination will stick.  Our bodies can handle that esp if you are eating a lot of fruits and veggies, their antioxidants will keep our cells healthy.  Beware of fish from the coast of Hokkaido, Iwate and Miyagi because they  still contain the highest amount of radiation.

I don't know where the heck they get that crap from and I can only picture this big cauldron full of tuna mush they put in the cans.

This is different, completely different. I almost got scared off by the couple of bad reviews, and maybe it used to be better, but I have no idea, its still pretty damned good.

It's like they sliced off a filet of the tuna and put it in a can ... exactly what I am used to. In my opinion you need to add some salt, but I eat it right from the can, its that good.

Its a big deal having to buy 12 cans when you are not sure if you'll like it, so I found some at a local supermarket (it was kinda hard to find) and tried one can before I bought the 12.

Ok, onto the tuna itself, Skipjack, I'd never heard of it. I have bought and tried both. The Albacore, in my opinion is definitely better, but it has WAY more calories per can. Now, the calories are mostly from fat, and its good fat, so not the end of the world. I still think the skipjack is a healthier option, but it definitely tastes leaner (and hence kinda more dry).

5511,5,True,1305676800,"Here's a thank you to Smashing Wool's [and another one] review for noting the can lining for this tuna is BPA-free.  I was wondering about that; I'm glad I took time to reread that review prior to posting mine. [As will be evident, I read and benefited from each of the reviews here when I posted mine. Thank you!]

I was sparked by SW's reminder of different ways to use tuna besides immediately snarfing it out of the can [one of the reasons I was curious about BPA].  Sometimes I leave some in the can and dump the rest into a pretty glass bowl, then snarf it after setting the can down for Arzel, my godly cat. She has to wait for what I leave in the can for her when I use the first method [I don't like to torture my cat with that type of wait].

I love this tuna so much and have missed real tuna for so many years of increasing takeover of soybean ooze, I dropped back to inhaling this TUNA unadulterated, after I [thank God, Jeff Bezos, and Amazon Customer Reviews] discovered this divine presentation.

In my first purchase I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Planet-Wild-Albacore-Tuna-No-Salt/dp/B002EYBB3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Planet Wild Albacore Tuna No Salt</a>. It sold me on all counts of its advertised positives, including the fact that the can is packed with big chunks of tuna MEAT which hasn't been smashed down into mush with lots of limp water and/or tons of soybean oil sludge.

The Albacore was PRIME, but I missed the uniquely natural, intensely healthy saltiness which identifies tuna to me [anyone interested could read Dr. Batmanghelidj's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Obesity-Cancer-Depression/dp/0970245823/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Obesity Cancer & Depression</a>, if he wants to know about the healing qualities of the right type of salt]. So I tried this Skipjack version to see if it had more of the SALTY tuna taste I crave.  A habit suddenly dissipated, a habit I had worked into with the Albacore, after a few cans of Skipjack had been digested unadulterated, with YUM in every bite.

In my long ago history of a sort of youth, when I could still see what tuna MEAT looked like in the can by evidence of it from a few un-smashed chunks big enough for human vision to register... way back then, I relished mixing mayo, chopped onions, garlic, celery, and sweet Gerkin's, etc., into canned tuna, for a sandwich or salad.  Yeah, as a 1947 born Baby Boomer I also made curried tuna casseroles and fresh dill laced pot pies; I prepared tuna in black-olive-and-mushroom studded, black-peppered gravy [or topped with chopped onions and melted Swiss cheese], and generously slipped it over a fully toasted bun or bagel, etc.

With this new dozen can collection of this Skipjack tuna, I found myself wanting to renew and expand that almost sacred recipe-rhapsody, minus soy, plus old-days healthy mayo; minus freshly-conjured, GMO-miasma-dredged additives; minus waste products declared illegal to touch or breathe being dumped into food products; you know, minus all that crud intelligent insects crawl away from when they'll live and flourish on genetically unmodified crude oils.  Other much older living Kindoms like bacteria, viruses, fungi, insects, etc., maybe have developed a type of sentience, even wisdom we might not ever achieve, though I do have hope [not the fake-hype type].

Oops. I may have turned over the tuna box and set my feet onto it, lol. Maybe that's a hint I should look for some organic, non GMO, no soy soap?

ANYway.  I searched Amazon for an organic, no GMO, NO SOY mayo so I could begin to reconnect with my yums of youth, which I may have never actually had... I did have honest ""yums""; it's the youth I question.  I may be getting one of those now, an attitude of youth, even though I'm dying from anti-nutrients not only passed off as, but pushed as ""food""?

Let the blessings begin, though they probably began with this Slipjack tuna. Here's the blessing I discovered and bought [which I hope I live long enough to review with high level rapture]:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wilderness-Family-Mayonnaise-Certified-Organic-16-fl-oz-jar/dp/B000XH8T8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wilderness Family Mayonnaise, Certified Organic, 16 fl. oz. jar</a>

That mayo and its family of producers is clearly blessed.

But this Skipjack tuna is so good, I finally quit adding even this mayo to it [not to worry, this type of mayo has a universe full of yum-and-yell ""yes!"" uses].

I take time to scoop the solid tuna meat out of the can and into a cut-glass, fancy dish only to leave some of it in the can for Arzel, though sometimes I put hers in cut-glass, too... until I realized she likes the can method because she can lick the tuna juice clean off the inside... which brings us back to what inspired this comment turned review:

Thank you, SW, for each detail in your review, especially for answering the BPA question I had in the back of my mind when I took time to reread.

As has been becoming a new habit, I meant to make a brief, off the top comment under a review I particularly appreciated, and ended up with more than the review I intended to write next.  Maybe there's some type of magic in a comment box which works for me even better than the review form, though I like the ease of that setup, too.

I opened a can of Skipjack before heading out to a local cafe for breakfast this morning; forked lifted some of the thick, lusciously dense meat into my cut-glass bowl, and left a good portion in the can for Arzel. I snarfed up several bites  [from my bowl] before storing the remainder in the fridge. I considered eating a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Larabar-Ginger-Snap/dp/B000EO0XAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Larabar Ginger Snap</a>, too, in defense against the varieties of soy I would be eating next, but didn't want to upset my appetite for a DENNY'S senior omelet. Hey! DENNY's is an icon from my youth. I wouldn't abandon it in its struggle through the dark ages of soy. [During one of my Dark Ages in February 1985 in Portland, Oregon, a Denny's ambiance, one-egg-breakfast helped lift my spirit out of a black hole. I began writing my first novel there, that morning, truly on the back of an envelop.]

I believe in getting a healthy core of food into me whenever possible, to counteract the soybean overwhelm I always try to work my soul around when eating in cherished restaurants of various types and locations, where I set up my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-NF210-A03-10-1-Inch-Netbook/dp/B004LB4A32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung NF210-A03 10.1-Inch Netbook</a>&nbsp;and type, type, type.

[Actually my beloved do-everything netbook, which I bought from Amazon, is a Samsung N220 Plus, but it's not available here currently, so I linked a comparable one above.]

Someday maybe GM enhanced Organisms will connect their significant intelligence with some of the innocent good people residing within the GMO soybean pushers paradigm... and communicate to them what REAL FOOD is and precisely why it's real. Maybe that core of realism will spread... like a good virus?

Maybe the trick would be to have the good guys [caught in the soybean web con] alternate bites from a regular can of smashed soy tuna, with bites from this offering of WILD SKIPJACK.  YES!!!!

Taste buds do have sentience.

I'm just saying...

But are they really better than their Spanish cousins, or those scooped out of adjacent waters by the Moroccan fleet?

A recent flurry of studies on the inconsistencies of professional blind tastings of wine calls things into question. If highly trained experts can't routinely get it right when rating expensive vintages, how much credence should anyone be placing on the sardine selections of Amazon reviewers?

It's up to you. Now, having issued this disclaimer I'll jump right in.

These fish just taste great.

Their flesh is both fat and firm, with a delicate aroma (though my daughter would argue they stink), and a fine lingering finish.

Presentation is impeccable. The plump pilchards are tightly packed into a heavy-duty rip top tin. You'll be amazed at the metallic sheen of their delicate skin. It attests to the freshness of these bad boys at the moment of their canning.

Does this seem over the top as it relates to lowly sardines?

Not at all. In fact this is a case where the last will indeed be first. Being at the bottom of the food chain sardines are free from concentrations of all manner of toxins. At the same time, they score high in their content of Omega-3 fatty acids.

I looked at the sodium content and noticed that it was same as some other tins of sardines that I had on the shelf but for some reason these were much more saltier than the other cans.

I tried two tins thinking that it could have been a tin of sardines that were over salted.  The can was also difficult to open but I've noticed this problem with other sardines from Portugal.  A difficult can does not bother me as long as the sardines are worth the effort to get the can open.

Pros:

(1) More substance - this can of sardine weighs 120g, only slightly more than the boneless/skinless (105g), however, they actually have a lot more sardines than the other one because the other one only have a few sardines floating in a lot of olive oil.  This one actually have more ""meat"" and at a price of $ 2.89 comparing to the $ 3.69 for the boneless/skinless version, this one is a better buy.

5534,5,False,1313107200,"I've been eating canned tuna for more than 40 years so that might make me an expert ""consumer"" of canned tuna. But seriously, when it comes to healthy eating, canned tuna has it all; rich in protein, low in fat and calories, and it's an excellent source of essential omega-3 fatty acids which help to lower blood pressure and cholesterol.

But most of us only eat it as ""tuna fish salad"", with mayo and maybe some chopped celery, because most of us have been brought up on lower quality tuna that tastes ""fishy"" or simply looks dark and icky (that's a technical term by the way, used by discerning children for decades). I did the same; ate lesser brands of tuna reluctantly as a child, adding everything from cheese to pickles to onions to mask the flavor of the stinky tuna. And the tuna you get in the average deli in my neck of the woods, well it's also cheap and it's usually mixed with sugar to help cut the fishy flavor and bread crumbs to extend the volume.

It wasn't until I was in my thirties that I decided to stop buying the less expensive brands and cuts of tuna and try something new, in hopes I would want to eat more tuna, and therefore eat healthier. I tried just about every brand and cut of canned tuna I could find in my local stores (in NY). And what I found was Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore (I prefer it packed in water) is the absolute best tasting tuna I could find. It's so good I can even eat it straight from the can, without doing anything to it!!

Although I can eat it straight, I do prefer it with a little mayo as a sandwich. But when I do make ""tuna salad"" with Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna I don't have to add all sorts of things to mask the flavor of the fish, because there is no ""fishy"" ickiness to it. When I'm in a hurry or just want something easy to make, I simply add a little black pepper and maybe a little lemon juice, and some mayo. It's fantastic, never fails, the quality and taste is always consistent. But, if I'm in the mood for something with a little more kick I add diced fresh veggies and herbs, maybe even some diced cheese like I did when I was a kid. Either way, straight, with mayo, or all dressed up, this tuna is without a doubt the best. I even find it to be better than Bumble Bee's more expensive tuna in the pouch. No need to waste your money on that when this tuna is perfectly fine just as it is.

Talking about money, you might notice the change in packages sizes in the last few years, for just about every product sold in the grocery stores these days. Used to be you had the choice of a 7 ounce can of tuna or the smaller single serve portion of about 3 ounces. Now most grocery stores don't offer the 7 ounce cans as the standard size. They offer the 5 ounce in place of it. All tuna's are now sold with 5 ounces being the standard can size, not just Bumble Bee. This is a trend throughout the food manufacturing industry, reducing the package size. But 7 ounce cans of tuna are not gone for good, not yet at least. You can still find them, and I have found, in my travels, the price per ounce for the 7 ounce can of Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna is often cheaper than the 5 ounce, when you can get it. So, I highly advise you shop around for the best price, and see if you can find the 7 ounce cans on sale. You'll find tips on this and other money saving advice on my blog. See my Amazon profile for details.

PS) I've had the privilege to eat wild tuna caught and canned locally on the coast of Washington state, and it is awesome, but I didn't include a comparison to those tunas in this review because they're a local product, not something everyone can get (or can easily get) in a national grocery store or supermarket chains. But if I were to compare Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna to those fresh caught & canned tuna's, Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore ranks right up there with the ones I've tried.",Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna is The Best,B001YJBN0M,Tuna Fish,"Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Premium Tuna in Water, 40 Ounce",0.9977935,1

Bonito del Norte is the very best-tasting tuna in the world! Better than fresh tuna I think. This is coming from me, someone who doesn't like fish at all. When I was little, and my father cooked fish, I started to gag and had to run out of the house, I hated that smell. I still hate that fishy taste. In a pinch, I will eat Albacore (white) tuna, but even that sometimes makes me gag (because I just am not able to stomach fish), and most of the can goes to waste, because I never want to touch it for weeks afterwards.

BUT! Bonito del Norte (not necessarily this particular brand, which I do enjoy) is the champagne of tuna - it tastes so mild, and buttery, it has its own distinct flavor, in between fish and meat. Best of all is the texture, very firm and dense.

When I was little, my family got to stay in my aunt's house in Spain, off season, when she couldn't rent it out to anyone else, and this was my favorite food: fresh baguette, and Bonito del Norte on top. A little bit goes a long way. You can spread a little mayo on the bread, and then put just a few pieces of this tuna on top, very sparingly (not like in American tuna sandwiches). It's the best. The taste is so exquisite, you can just open the can and eat it out of the can with a fork, without mayo. If you do use mayo, use very litte, as not to overpower the delicate taste.

Wikipedia states that Spaniards call Albacore tuna (white tuna)  Bonito del Norte  That may be so, but the Bonito del Norte that is canned in Spain tastes totally different from the Albacore tuna normally available in the supermarket in the US, even the most expensive brands. Starkist sells a White Tuna in olive oil, which should theoretically taste the same as the Bonito del Norte in olive oil, according to Wikipedia, but that's not the case. The American Albacore white tuna has a much stronger, coarser taste. The Bonito del Norte has  buttery taste, which manages to be delicate and at the same time concentrated. Therefore a litte goes a long way.

Yes, Bonito del Norte is always expensive, even in Spain, but I hope that you try to taste it just once in you life, which is why I'm writing this review.

PS I have had fresh (very expensive) Ahi tuna in Hawaii, grilled. It was good, but still too fishy. I've made tuna salad out the leftover cold Ahi, with mayo the next day. That tasted better, nice and firm meat, less fishy than eaten hot. But for me, nothing in the world can touch the sublime taste of this canned Bonito del Norte.","A delicous, buttery tuna for people who can't stand fish (like I)",B0021491QM,Tuna Fish,"Ortiz Bonito Del Norte - White Tuna in Olive Oil, 3.95-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)",0.9977958,1

Good but not awesome. Then over the last couple of months, even the quality of their tuna has diminished.

5638,3,True,1287100800,"I ordered this tuna ready to be blown away and and quite frankly I wasn't (except by the cost!). As far as canned tuna goes this is really good, but it is also really expensive. I was expecting something with perhaps a better texture than 'regular' canned, but while it is very good it's still canned tuna. At this price per pound I had higher expectations. Again, this is good canned tuna and I would rate it higher but I don't think the cost is justified. One thing to keep in mind when comparing this tuna to other store bought brands: make sure to buy canned tuna packed in olive oil. Tuna in water tends to be 'mushy' and not as 'flaky' as oil packed tuna.

I would suggest trying out the canned tuna from Fishing Vessel St. Jude. They are a Seattle based company and they test their tuna for mercury and post the results on their website.

Put one in the lunch with a few fresh fruit and veggie items and perhaps a few dried fruits and nuts. It's good nutrition, and there's no worry about weight gain. Also, when I'm camping, I like to take a batch of these tuna cups along. In both cases, the cup size just the right for one serving.

I had a minor problem with the latest tuna cups, and it might be just a batch problem. My latest tuna was very dry. I almost had to choke it down. And it seemed rather tasteless. I've had these cups in the past and they seemed much better. I have not been satisfied with the present ones. However, I like the product and the serving size and It will not deter me from future purchases.

5649,5,False,1272240000,"I eat these tuna cups (or the salmon cups) almost daily.

If you're looking for a nutritious snack, these cups really can't be beat.  If you're a bodybuilder or athlete trying to increase your daily protein intake, these are awesome.  If you're a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy, getting them to like fish is a great idea.  If you're trying to eat 5-7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.  It also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience.

Why eat a nutritionally empty ""100 calorie pack"" of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit??

I'll eat these alone, straight from the cup, basically anywhere since you don't need to refridgerate and you don't need a can opener.  I'll dump them onto salad, or mix with rice, quinoa, or beans.

Here's the nutrition data off the back (for 1 2.7oz cup) at the time of writing:

Calories 80 (10 from fat)
Total Fat 1g
Cholesterol 35mg
Sodium 15mg
Total Carb 0g
Protein 18g
Omega-3 EPA/DHA 200mg

You really can't beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration.  The package says ""in water"" but there's a little bit of broth in the cup, and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup, you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg.

I highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well.  But, avoid the tuna salad, or the flavored varieties if you are looking to get the maximum nutritional benefit.  Those salads and flavorings just add salt, sugar, carbs.","Awesome snack, great product.",B0025UALB6,Tuna Fish,"Chicken of the Sea Tuna Chunk White Water Cup, 2-2.8-Ounce (Pack of 8)",0.9978417,1

5695,4,True,1367280000,"I love the bumble bee tuna salad and usually get it with just the crackers, but wanted more of a full lunch on-the-run type thing so tried this.

The only complaint I have is that the tuna is a smaller portion than the kit with just the crackers. And on the other side, this is high in fat as others have noted. But it is leaps and bounds better than the dry tuna in a pouch.

The crackers also appear to have changed, they are very small, which means they break real easy. I generally don't use the crackers provided, but it is irritating that they are usually broken in the package.

I justify the higher fat by the fact that this will work as an alternative to grabbing something at fast food when you are stuck at work, or traffic.  You are getting some nutrition from this and it does taste really good.

The cookie is actually really good. I didn't really have high hopes for the cookie, but it is seriously good.","Not the healthy way to eat tuna, but even the cookie is great.",B0025VF8FY,Tuna Fish,"Bumble Bee Foods Lunch On The Run Tuna Salad Kit, 8.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8)",0.9977563,1

I put one in each of our 72-hour emergency bags along with some other food, and left the others in my pantry.  We ate the extra ones and liked all the contents: tuna salad in a pop-top can, a container of diced peaches, a package of crackers, a spork and a cookie.  They aren't health food by any means, but they are perfect for what they are - a quick, easy meal.  My husband tosses one in his briefcase when he thinks he might be stuck on the phone during lunch, and it's saved him from going hungry a couple of times.

I like to keep an extra sleeve of crackers in my drawer at work to finish off the tuna.

The tuna can looks small, but it is plenty for me.  The included peach cup is a nice touch to round out the lunch.

The cookie on the other hand is bland, dry, brittle, and tasteless.  I'd almost prefer no cookie than what they have included in this kit.  They either need to drop the cookie all together or replace it with something a little better tasting.

When you open them up, if the salt they are packed in is all pretty much white, just transfer them into a container that you can close tightly and put into the refrigerator.  If the salt is brown and has liquid, pour off all the liquid that you can, transfer into the jar, and cover with Kosher salt, then into the refrigerator. We have gotten them when they just arrived from Italy here locally in Scottsdale, ordered them from an importer in Pittsburg, and from Amazon.  Sometimes they have the brown liquid and sometimes they don't.  You just have to treat them right.  To keep them from getting mushy, they need to be covered in salt. When you are going to use these, pick out the ones you want, rinse off the salt, pinch off the tail fin if it is there, open them up and take out the backbone and the innards. I do this under running water, which helps the process, while getting rid of the extra salt. These are really good in salads and salad dressings.  I also use them most anywhere you would use salt, soy sauce or Thai fish sauce in cooking.  Chop them up, and they will dissolve when you cook with them.  No one will know they are there, but there is a really interesting flavor. I really like them in white clam sauce and many other pasta sauces.  Another good use is Jansson's temptation, which is Swedish scalloped potatoes with anchovies layered in before you bake it.

Preparation is very easy. Just rinse, and remove the bone and the tail fin. This was much easier than I thought it would be.

I then soaked them for 30 minutes in water and this really seemed to reduce the saltiness.

I then transferred the rest from the can and put into sealable container, covered with salt and left in the fridge.

They are tasty. They taste just like they came from the sea. And they are less salty than the canned variety which is good for my diet. Will be buying again!

These are also the best brand I have found on Amazon.  The fish are bigger.

These are the real thing from Sicily, little whole fishies packed in about 20% salt and brine.  Not sayin' I recommend this to others but I just run cold water or soak them a little, take off the tiny heads and tails, and use the rest usually chopped up in anchovy dressing, fish dishes, sauces, stews, and whatever you like.  Whatever tiny bones remaining I just never notice.

These in my opinion are kinda salty but I usually use only one or two at a time and never add table salt so they usually blend in well with most dishes.

Here's what I really like about these anchovies.  Mortar them up with some olive oil, a little Dijon, some garlic and whatever and you have a dynamite dressing to drizzle over salads and raw vegetables.  The result for me is eating a healthier diet and sending my cholesterol way down. (Not conjecture, actual results)  Anchovies have the omega 3's and other health benefits, and are much better and safer to eat than larger fish which are said to contain um higher levels of you know what. Right now I'm on my second can and of course another benefit is not running out and having to run to the store.

Actually, peeling the filets off is pretty simple just do it under running water and start from the head end and peel off one filet at a time - takes about 10 seconds per fish.  As others have said, they are not as salty as oil packed because you really need to rinse them off.  Also, soaking these fish first is completely unnecessary.

These are premium Anchovies whose quality far exceeds the supermarket variety. These anchovies are nothing like the slender, stiff, olive oil soaked fillet ""saltbombs"" found in the little 2OZ tins or glass jars at supermarkets everywhere. It would take about 16 of these tiny 2 OZ cans to approximate the same amount sold here. At up to $2.50 for 2OZ fillets X 16 the economic advantage becomes clear. In any case, it is the exceptional quality, size and flavor that should guide your purchase.
 As a bonus (if prepared correctly) they have a much reduced sodium content. It is true that they require simple preparation: Rinse the salt and soak in fresh water for about a 1/2 hour before filleting and easily removing the spine bone and optionally scales. A simple task that is rewarded by a supple, meaty anchovy fillet that makes any dish requiring anchovies as good as it can get. I usually soak and fillet the contents of the entire can in advance and put them in a small jar submerged in olive oil and store in the refrigerator for long term availability. You can also store the unused portion in the can they were packed in by salting the next exposed layer as the item description suggests but, for me, fiddling with plastic wrap and exposing the fish to absorb the flavor of the can in the refrigerator is solved by re-packing them in a convienient sealable container.
Used in pasta dishes with roasted grape tomatoes,sliced garlic, and olive oil(Acciughe + Pomodoro) you'll soon wish the can was even bigger. Try a three or four of them mashed with a few cloves of garlic & a tablespoon or two of tomato paste and add to beef stew for that subltle ""Umami"" flavor that enhances the beef flavor without any ""Fishy"" taste. Diners (including fussy children) will detect there's somthing special, but will not suspect fish had anything to do with it. It has the same effect as Worchester sauce or Thai fish sauce which is essentially fermented fish. These savory anchovies melt away in a variety of sauces and stews.

The surprising and very good news is that they also cut the price from $27 to $16. So the price actually went down from $4.50 per can to $2.67 per can. That brought the price per oz down from $0.77/oz to $0.55/oz. ---- a very substantial (almost 40%) savings! The quality is still very good, and it's actually a much better buy now.

On the minus side, I do not like the fact that Wild Planet decided to ditch the Minimal Mercury Albacore and instead is pushing it's Minimal Mercury Skip-jack tuna instead.

Additionally, I am not thrilled that this product is now coming from Vietnam---according to the product description. I prefer my troll caught albacore tuna to come from clean waters of Alaska or Oregon.

But in light of today's economy, getting such excellent tuna for almost 40% less --- only $0.55/oz when a closely equivalent version previously cost $0.77/oz is a remarkable and welcome change.

5955,5,False,1371427200,"One of the reasons this tuna tastes so much better than other brands is that they only cook it once, right in the can with no added liquid.  Most brands cook their tuna twice which degrades the flavor and the texture.  This no water/oil version is my go-to choice for everyday tuna salad & even using on a green salad or eating on a cracker.  It is large pieces of tuna so after I open it, I use a butter knife & slice it in to large chunks right in the can; also helps make it easier to get out of the can.  Don't drain away the tiny bit of liquid in the can.  That liquid is the ""juices"" from the tuna; not added water.  This tuna is delicious and was the winner in the Cook's Illustrated canned tuna tasting (7/2011).

Wild Planet uses fish caught by ""trolling or pole & line"" which is the recommendation by most non-governmental environmental fishing watch groups including the Monterey Bay Aquarium ""Seafood Watch"".  These fishing methods do not reach as deep in to the water so they catch younger, more tasty, more Omega 3 -rich fish & less mercury.  The bigger, older fish typically swim deeper & because they are older, they have higher mercury levels.

Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood watch has an excellent website, app for your phone & a pocket guide advising on which seafood is safest to eat and sustainable.

I Bought this for my Mother as a Birthday Gift as the other Tuna suppler has gone out of business. When I called her about it all she could do is say it's the BEST tasting TUNA she has had since the other place was in business. She is very picky in what she eats. And has been looking for a good source of tune for the past year and a 1/2 or so. Now that she has found this tuna I've have her on the auto shipment of 6 cans every 3 months and I may need to change that to more often. I buy this tuna because at age 96 if Mom likes it and will eat it and it's good for her I have no problems at all getting it for her. And my understanding is the the tuna is only canned in Vietnam, the tuna is Wild caught & all natural. Sustainably caught by fishermen out of various ports along the Pacific Coast. Why it's canned in Vietnam is anybody's guess. I would highly recommend this Tuna for it's teats & Quality.","Wild Planet Sustainably Caught Wild Albacore Tuna, 5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)",B002EY5TTW,Tuna Fish,"Wild Planet, Wild Albacore Tuna, 5-Ounce Cans, Pack of 6",0.9976582,1

I am a student in a masters program (Physician Assistant) and always have cans of this in my locker for lunch in case I forget something. It has come in handy!

The taste is really strong, but that is what I like. Regarding the metallic taste, I have only tasted a metallic taste once and that was the unsalted variety. I have probably eaten 200 cans of this over the years and have only tasted that once. So I don't think it's a common problem.

I think this tuna is for someone who doesn't really want to have to add a bunch of stuff to it to make it palatable/taste good. It's a bit pricy, but well worth it for the convenience and nutritional value.

One thing to be cautious of is that if you want to put a lot of stuff in it, this might be a bit too salty for that. I find this pretty salty, but you'd have to judge yourself. I buy both the unsalted and the salted. If I'm making a tuna salad or tuna melts, I use the unsalted and add in salt to taste. Otherwise, I find it's too salty.

This brand is one I trust to provide good quality and environmentally superior to the other brands, when it comes to buying fish. The taste is good. Although some customers raved about the taste, I didn't find it to taste that much different than what I'd been used to: Solid White Albacore. It tastes very much like the brands of solid albacore I'd been eating for years ... not much different, except I have the knowledge that this is healthier for me, and I don't want the added mercury in it.

One thing I do differently with this brand, is that I don't throw out the liquid that's in the can. (I read on the label that it's NOT to be tossed out. It contains a lot of the Omega 3's, and exists ""naturally"" with the fishing process. When I mash it up with a fork to make tuna salad, that liquid simply gets absorbed into the tuna, and it's not wetter than usual. At least I know I'm getting the advantages of the ""good fats"", in an environmentally conscious product that's healthy. I'm finding it helpful to purchase this on the Subscribe and Save, so I don't run out. Last thing to mention: If you're used to making enough tuna for at least a couple of sandwiches, remember that these cans aren't very big. You'll probably wind up using two cans each time you make something with it, unless you're eating alone. If they carried this in a larger sized can, I'd prefer it, but am not complaining.)

And - I THOUGHT it was fully caught AND packed in the USA* (*It is packed in Vietnam.)  See their web site, and click on the FAQ page - it tells that info there.

I love Genovo Tonno - so I thought this tuna would be even better. Wrong. You open the can and find a relatively dry hunk of tuna that smells a little cat-foodish, with some limited liquid around the lump. Dumping it out, it doesn't break up very easily, but I persisted and succeeded in making it ready for a sandwich. Taste was uninspiring. There wasn't much taste - and what was there was just ever so slightly unappealing. I couldn't finish the sandwich. I normally LOVE tuna - but not this.

Thinking it was just me not liking it, I gave the rest to a person who will eat ANY brand of tuna and love it. In fact, he's one of those cast-iron stomach people who will and can eat anything. He didn't finish his sample either, because he said it was dryish and tasted unappetizing. So, it isn't just ""me"".

I REALLY wanted to love this. But I can't stomach it. I'll just buy either the can of Genovo Tonno or Starkist's Yellowfin tuna in foil packets from now on. Those taste like tuna and make me want more. Granted, they're  higher in mercury - full grown yellow-fin is almost as high as albacore in mercury, but I'll keep my consumption down to one packet (2.6 ounce) or can (3 ounce) a week which is below the danger limit for a very small woman. I'd rather eat less tuna that I simply LOVE, than eat a whole bunch of tuna that I can't choke down.

6086,5,True,1297641600,"I've been using this tuna for many months, buying it here on Amazon, and it has always been excellent! I've given away a few cans to friends and co-workers without mentioning anything, and all of them have came back and asked me for more info about it. It is simply the best tuna I've ever had by far!

Read the labels and research yourself where your tuna is coming from, and how it is processed. I don't know of any tuna that is completely wild, line caught in the US and hand selected in the 17 lb size, and cooked in the can with no water added. Any liquid in the can are Omega 3 oils, so do NOT drain the liquid! The oils mix together very good with the tuna by itself, or in to a salad. It's like an anti-freeze for the blood, in addition to benefits.

Most tuna comes from Asia, or elsewhere overseas, and much of it is wild tuna, caught and kept in pens, and fed by humans to fatten them up. Animal Planet uses sushi-grade line caught tuna, hand selected in the smaller sizes (called ""peanut size"" to the sport fishing crowd). And the sushi-grade means caught, immediately bled, and put on ice. Ask any sport fisherman, they all know this is the only method to use to ensure good tasting tuna. You will not have sushi-grade tuna unless you do this process, and quickly. It's the KEY to great tasting tuna. Having had wild caught sport albacore locally, and being involved with the sport fishing group, I have learned this. Check out other brands and then read about Wild Planet, and then make the taste taste.

6094,5,True,1276300800,"I originally tried Wild Planet tuna back in 2006 when Amazon carried their ""minimal mercury"" products, and I was extremely impressed by the taste and the quality of the tuna.  I was never a fan of tuna in the past, but I thought their canned tuna was outstanding.  They stopped selling tuna with the ""minimal mercury"" label, and I drifted away from buying tuna until recently.  I decided to try Wild Planet again.  I don't know if their ""low mercury"" label is any different or perhaps the standard definitions have changed, but the online discussions make be believe that the mercury content in this product is really quite low.

The taste is still excellent, and I'm happy to see that the product is still like it was over three years ago - in that the chunks of tuna are large and nothing is added (besides salt in some versions).  The natural juices from the fish keep it very moist and taste great.

I also believe that their fishing practices are more sustainable and have less collateral damage (i.e. killing other animals) than other methods.  That makes me feel much better about buying their products.  Few things make me as upset as needless death or outright cruelty, and so while I enjoy eating meat and seafood, I look for people and brands that strive to avoid those things.",High quality tuna that's easier on my conscience,B002EYBB3A,Tuna Fish," Wild Planet, Wild Albacore Tuna, No Salt Added, 5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 6) ",0.9977696,1

The  funny thing: it actually tastes more like real tuna (and good tuna at that), whereas the Bumble Bee seems to have been bleached of the flavor somehow.

6203,3,True,1334793600,"UPDATED 5/28/12:
I see the price of these has gone up more than 50%, although I believe the earlier price was in error, so I will not be buying these in the future. It seems that buying 24 cans in warehouse packaging should be a better deal than this is offering to us. In addition my last two shipments were a bit less fish and more oil than the first ones. For those reasons I have dropped my earlier rating of 5 to 3 stars.

Incidentally, I never received a response from the company as to why the front of the can says 120gm and the box says 95gm.
========================

In the words of that wonderful Tina Turner classic- ""Simply the Best.""

These are excellent in almost every way. Only the can itself could be improved.  I will admit that the container can be quite a challenge.  While it pops open easily, peeling the top gets progressively more difficult as you proceed.  It is nearly impossible to remove the lid entirely- and truly impossible to do so without ejecting  a bit of the oil from the can.  According to the packaging and can imprints, the sardines are caught wild and canned in Morocco. I think the containers might be made from abandoned WW II German tanks.

That said, it is well worth the struggle.  Every can of the original 24 was fully packed with 4 fairly large, tan in color sardines: skinless (there were perhaps three sardines in the 24  cans with the slightest trace of skin remaining) and absolutely no bone. The taste and texture are excellent.  I have never had any particular thrill from olive oil, so the fact that these are in soy oil (and filled to the brim) was no problem for me to say the least.  Lightly salted (for sardines). You will almost surely be consuming 100% of the can content.

This might not be the first choice of the top-tier of gourmet consumers (I am not one), but I can not imagine any sardine lover, nor many non-lovers, not being extremely pleased with this product.

This is truly a 5-star selection.

Note that while the front of the box says: ""Net Wt. 4.25 OZ (120g)""
the Nutrition Facts on the back of the box show it as 95g  which is 3.35 OZ

6212,4,False,1293062400,"I initially purchased a few varieties of the Bumble Bee Salad snack kits to take out deer hunting with me.  I was looking for something easy to carry, didn't take up much room, was tasty, and would last for awhile without spoilage.

The kit comes with a 3 ounce can of tuna salad, 6 crackers, and a small plastic paddle to spoon the salad on the crackers.  The tuna is in a metal can with a foil lid and the crackers are in a small cellophane (foil looking) pouch.  The little plastic piece is just floating around in there.

After being carried and tossed around for a few weeks, I tore open a pack.  The crackers did not hold up too well to the abuse and were mostly a stack of pieces and crumbs.  The cardboard was splitting open allowing dirt to get inside, but at least the little plastic thing was still in there.

The taste of the salad was actually quite good.  I did not think it had an overwhelming fishy smell which could be beneficial if you are eating it in close quarters to others who might not like fish.  There is more than enough salad for the crackers which is a nice surprise as most snacks seem to make you ration the spread.

If you are on a diet, this meager snack is definitely not worth the 300 calories.  If you are looking for something portable to take on the road, hiking, fishing, hunting, or a snack to send to a soldier in the field, this is a handy, self contained snack.  If the packaging was a bit more durable to protect the crackers, I would say this would be pretty close to the perfect field snack.

6250,3,True,1336867200,"At first, I thought that this product deserves 4 or 5 stars.  What changed my mind?  ADVANTAGES:  (1)Most of the crabmeat in the can is adequate-quality white crabmeat but the top layer of the can is extremely high quality red-colored whole legs of small crabs.  Overall, the quality of the crabmeat in this product is higher than any other non-lump crabmeat product.  Only the very expensive cans of ""lump"" crabmeat have higher quality contents than this Chicken of the Sea product.  (2)This product can be conveniently opened with a can opener.  No need to worry about splatter.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)The quantity of crabmeat is just mediocre.  After draining away the water by squeezing the opened can, the crabmeat is only at about 60% of the altitude of the can in this Chicken of the Sea product.  That's better than Roland Consul brand Crab Meat, which goes below 50%, but not as good as other brands of canned crabmeat which can end up at about 70% to 80% of the altitude of the can.  (2)The other disadvantage is that Chicken of the Sea makes the mistake of putting a piece of transparent paper at the bottom of the can which clings to the crabmeat.  Each time I open a can of this product, I first enjoy eating the high quality crabmeat but then I eventually end up suffering the inconvenience of licking the crabmeat off of the paper.

Real fishermen, real families, sustainable fishing practices. Plus excellent customer service provided by the real families that catch the fish. I actually spoke with one of the fishermen's wives after calling for more information about the mercury testing. I could not have been more impressed.

Pole caught fish means I don't worry about mercury levels; they do independent tests for that too just in case. You can ask for copies of the testing.

Tastes better than any other brand of tuna I've ever had. Folks that say it's dry maybe have not read the part where it's not meant to be drained.

6257,5,False,1316649600,"My fiance pointed out to me the many downsides to regular canned tuna, from high mercury to one lb of by-catch of other fish and sea turtles for every lb of tuna caught the typical, ""sea chicken"" commercial way (note, 1:1 !). Even though dolphins have been pretty much eliminated as by-catch in US sold tuna, much other sea life has not. The only alternative to get much lower mercury and very low by-catch is by troll or pole catching. American Tuna and Wild Planet apply these techniques (see American's www site for interesting videos of the work intensive catching process by pole). I tried both and even though I liked Wild Planet Tuna over ""regular"" canned tuna, American Tuna is even better and especially fresher tasting! Its so good it was hard to believe it came out of a can when we first tried. Other benefits of American over Wild Planet is the even lower, ~ 1/2 mercury level compared to Wild Planet, and that it is not just caught in the US but also canned here, whereas Wild Planet apparently ships their US caught tuna to Vietnam for canning and then ships it back!?

Of course this American Tuna can't quite be as good as a nice seafood restaurant, but it's the best you're going to find in a can.

It has more than twice as much Omega 3's as the nearest competition and less sodium too.
The great thing about this tuna is it doesn't have that metallic taste the Wild Planet Vietnamese Tuna. This tuna is pole caught in/near the USA, and packaged in the USA as well. But you can read that in the description.
Something else that is accurate in the description is the fact that you don't have to drain. You can eat it right out of the can, and there will only be a very small amount of fish oil in the bottom when you're done.

If I were to say anything negative it would be that there is slightly too much salt for my taste, but they do have a non-salted version.

Regarding taste, the American Tuna was a dense and slightly dry hunk of fish surrounded by some fish juice and oil. The consistency was a little like canned salmon. It tasted ok from the can, but once mixed into a salad with chickpeas, it was a little too catfood-like.

6330,5,True,1380153600,"For a long time now, I've been too trusting and nave when it comes to buying tuna. The truth is: the lion's share of ""tuna"" available in the U.S. today is really escolar, a fish that many call toxic. In reality, escolar is not exactly toxic, but if eaten in amounts more than about six ounces at a time, it will very likely lead to a bad case of stomach cramps and diarrhea. The problem with escolar is that the fish contains a large amount of indigestible waxy compounds; these compounds make the fish taste as if it contained a lot of natural fish oils, but the gut cannot digest these waxy, oil-like molecules and they pass through the body quickly...in many cases, far too quickly! Escolar is a lot cheaper and more plentiful than real albacore tuna, and that's why it's taken the place of tuna in fish markets, grocery stores, and restaurants. Even highly priced sushi-grade tuna is, more often than not, escolar.

Are we all the victims of false advertising? No, federal food laws allow escolar to be sold under various misleading names including white tuna and solid white tuna.

So what can you do to make certain that you are not eating escolar? Well, one solution is to buy American Tuna MSC Certified Sustainable Caught Albacore Tuna. I tried it and I am thoroughly sold on the product! I'll never go back to buying fraudulent escolar ""tuna"" again.

From the first moment I opened the can of American Tuna, I knew that this was the real stuff...the one that I was used to eating in my youth more than forty-five years ago. It smelled better. It tasted better. It flaked better. And to top it off, it make me feel good about my purchase because it was genuine MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) sustainably caught albacore tuna.  What does that mean? It means that the fishery meets the strict environmental standards set by the MSC and the fish are harvested in a sustainable and well-managed fishery. For me, it just means I'm being a caretaker of the ocean and its inhabitants rather than a plunderer.

But it really gets back to taste; that's the critical factor. I did a taste comparison. I still had a can of the store-bought brand ""solid white tuna"" on hand. So I opened both cans--the American Tuna, and the ""solid white tuna"" (escolar)--and compared the two. I added the usual ingredients I use to make a tasty tuna salad (olive oil, diced onion, salt, lemon juice, capers, mayonnaise) and tried the two side-by-side. There was no comparison: the American Tuna was far superior in flavor. I ended up throwing away the other one, even though I ended up wasting good olive oil and capers in the process.  [Tip: be sure not to throw away the liquor in the can with the American Tuna; it is nutritional gold and good tasting, too...just add it back into your recipe and the flaked tuna will absorb it nicely.]

In the future I will probably buy this product at a specialty store not too far from my home. There, American Tuna sells for about a dollar cheaper per can  than I can get it here. But if you cannot find a local dealer for this tuna, then it is worth your money to buy it here online.","Finally guaranteed real tuna, not escolar!",B003IWV3U8,Tuna Fish,"American Tuna MSC Certified Sustainable Pole &amp; Line Caught Albacore Tuna, 6oz Can No-Salt Added, Caught &amp; Canned in America (6 Pack)",0.99713755,1

One day I was in Whole Foods and spotted American Tuna for $4.95 a can,quite a bit cheaper than buying it online and no shipping costs .I don't know what has happened to tuna ,back in the 1950's tuna was so good I couldn't get enough of it ,it all came from Japan and cost .25c a can. I remember Geisha ,Fraser and S.S.Pierce all outstanding tuna ,and then they changed something happened  ,we now had the new Geisha,Chicken of the Sea ,and Starkist all crap . One day I was watching the Today Show and this tuna guru was touting the best tasting tuna ,his number 1 which I tried,was too expensive ,so I went to number 2 American Tuna which I buy from time to time .I have tasted Wild Planet ,not in the same league .A friend telling me one day that tuna was tuna arranged a tuna taste off and laid out 8 different cans of tuna .A bunch of us participated in this ,not surprising my no 1 pick was an imported brand costing $9 a can ,my no
 2 was American Tuna ,all the rest was garbage . If you want great tuna though not as good as it used to be ,go to Whole Foods and save some money.

9/11/2016

I have an update ,after decades of buying American Tuna ,I have become disappointed by the quality, not up to par. I bought 2 cases 24 cans from the company .As I open each can hoping the next one will be like I'm used to. No it's hard,hard to mix,no longer pink ,flaky mixes easy and so fresh tasting. Now it's hard ,tough like Bumble Bee .I don't know hat happened ,but I feel let down ,their quality is down. I don't know if it was just a bad batch or the new norm. I won't buy this by the case anymore..I can buy individual cans from Whole Foods and if the quality is down find another brand.

I gave my daughter all the cans left over ,and went into Whole Foods and bought 5 cans .I was blown away, the Whole Food cans were just as fresh and tasty as I was used to. Nice pinkish tender tuna mixes easily and can't stop tasting it. So what happened?Well I wrote to the company ,guess what? they ignored me,most companies would have responded if they were constructively critisized. There must be something going on. Is tuna like steak ,are there tenderloin and chuck type tuna meat. Is American Tuna selling prime to Whole Foods and inferior tuna to mail order. I will never know because American Tuna isn't saying and since buying direct costs the same as buying in the store and no shipping costs. Bottom line ,if you like American Tuna as much as I do ,don't buy it from the company ,by it elsewhere,you might be surprised by the difference in quality .And I'm taking off 1 star .",No Longer the best,B003IWV3U8,Tuna Fish,"American Tuna MSC Certified Sustainable Pole &amp; Line Caught Albacore Tuna, 6oz Can No-Salt Added, Caught &amp; Canned in America (6 Pack)",-0.9983305,1

All Chicken of the Sea salmon is wild-caught in the waters of the Pacific. None of our canned and pouched salmon, which include traditional red salmon, traditional pink salmon and boneless & skinless pink salmon, are farm-raised. A natural source of the fatty acid omega-3, which positively impacts heart health and more, our salmon is a good source of protein and nutrients and can be enjoyed without the related health concerns to farm-raised salmon.""

I got the regular Pink, not Smoked, Salmon.

The taste has been fine so far.

I prefer salmon over tuna and love these packets because the salmon tastes fresher with less liquid.  I take salmon and mix with miracle whip, dill weed, sometimes capers, finely shredded colby jack and add something crunchy, bits of celery or carrot.  Yummy.

Not a ton in this package, but enough, when mixed with things like bread crumbs for a small salmon patty.

So I saw the new varieties, including both the ""Barbecue"" and the ""Sweet & Spicy"" flavors, and I decided to try them.  Mistake.

Um... there is no way to put it gently, the ""Barbecue"" flavor is awful.  It's like they dumped an entire stockpile of concentrated chemical smoke flavor into the salmon - it is not at all subtle, measured or desirable.  It's listed on the ingredients as ""chargrill flavor.""  It is strong.  It is nasty.  It is horrible.  Even the smell is extremely offputting.  I don't know what they were thinking.  I can see maybe going for a subtle, sweet smoky salmon, but what they did hits you like ton of bricks in a most unpleasant way.  Blaaaeeewwwaaaa!  I wonder if anyone could have actually taste tested this?  Aren't there usually panels of people they try stuff on first?  And this was the result?  There has to be a mistake somewhere.  Trust me on this, stay away from the Barbecue.

The ""Sweet & Spicy"" flavor is definitely not as bad as the ""Barbecue"" flavor, but I don't see myself ordering it again.  There is an underlying smoke flavor that is present, not nearly as powerful as it is in the Barbecue flavor, but it is there.  There is no heat to the ""Sweet & Spicy"" flavor, so it's not like spicy hot... just that they used spices.  I'd give it three stars.

I have not tried the ""Lemon Pepper.""

The entry is distinctly Sriracha flavor with its sweet, spiciness.  After the Sriracha, the middle is a slight burn which I like as I usually find most hot products to be on the wimpy side.  There is a slight fishy flavor on the back end.  Honestly, I would not be able to pick it out as salmon if I were doing a blind taste test.

The texture from the pouched salmon is a bit mixed.  The texture is much firmer than the salmon I have eaten that comes in a can.  There were some firm pieces in the pouch, but there was a significant amount of mushy product as well.

I could see using this product if I were making something such as a dip or a salmon patty and I wanted the taste and heat of Sriracha sauce in the recipe.  However, as far as eating this directly from the pouch, I thought it was good, but it was not my cup of tea.  I like the taste of salmon and this product tasted mostly like Sriracha.",Great If You Like The Taste Of Sriracha,B003RWVFEI,Salmon,"Chicken of the Sea Premium Skinless &amp; Boneless Pink Salmon, 2.5 oz.

6596,3,True,1453334400,"Of the commercially available wild salmon species, pink salmon is the easily the least desirable. But that makes it perfect for this application (i.e. canned/retorted). You wouldn't want to ruin a king or coho salmon by processing it in the manner.

This product is a great substitute for canned tuna. I eat it on salad or on toast, or will mix with mayo and put on a sandwich. The fanciest thing I make with this is pan fried salmon cakes (drain, mix with bread crumbs, mayo, dijon, egg, and whatever spices/herbs), which is easy and quite tasty.

Wild caught pink salmon is also a sustainable fishery, so you can eat this knowing you are not contributing to the endangerment of a fish species. However, the product is caught in the North Pacific, shipped to Thailand for processing and packaging, and then shipped to North America. That's quite the journey and carbon footprint. The price we pay for affordable and convenient (I deducted a star because of this).

Chicken of the Sea is owned by Thai Union Group, which helps explain why North Pacific pink salmon is shipped all the way to Thailand for processing. Thai Union Group has been accused of being linked (indirectly) to slavery on the open seas by some of their suppliers. Many of their products make their way into the US market, especially in the form of pet food. I hope that no slave labor is used in the production of this product (I would assume not, because most of the reported slavery were on Thai vessels in the South China Sea, not in the North Pacific), but I really have to consider that it is a possibility after what I've been reading on this topic. The Associated Press and the NY Times published articles last year regarding slavery on fishing vessels last year (2015); google it for more info. Another source of info is the Wikipedia page for Thai Union Group.

6747,5,True,1414108800,"I'm eating this as I type this.  Well, not LITERALLY.. but I do have a plate of sitting next to me.. I was compelled to hop on and share just how absolutely delicious this is.

I was a bit skeptical.. I live in Seattle and we get some fantastic salmon here.  But who can afford to purchase fresh salmon for lunch daily.. who also has the time to grill up salmon just for lunch. While I am very health concious and pay close attention to what I eat...I'm not J.Lo.. I don't have a private chef to grill up salmon for me daily.. so the price seemed very affordable for these bad boys so I grabbed a 12 pack.

THEY ARE DELICIOUS... they offer so much fun flexibility beyond the grilled chicken salad lunches I was growing tired of eating daily.. (sorry Foreman Grill.. time to give you a bit of a break..)..  I throw some greens in a bowl with a few other veggies and toss this is my lunch bag.  I've even just keep a few packs in my desk at work.  They came in handy when I had forgotten to make my salad...  Today, I'm eating just the salmon with some roasted brussel sprouts I found at TJ's  (that's Trader Joes to those of you not IN THE KNOW..)  And it is a DELICIOUS COMBINATION.

Because salmon is deliciously high in protein, my lunches are very light and very filling and sustain me throughout the day.  I hate heavy lunches.. who wants to eat a bunch of pasta or carby sandwich only to feel like they want to take a nap when they get back to their desk.  No sir-reee.. not this gal!

The product is absolutely great, I don't care about the bones, actually the spine, and the skin that comes with the delicious meat  - the spines are quite soft and very healthy as they supply calcium. The brine is in itself a treat.

I have had the can hidden somewhere for years, and found it three days ago. The stamp on the bottom of the can said: ""Best by Aug 2010""  -  that's right: 2010. I didn't throw it away, instead I opened it.

The content looked just fine, the smell was normal (meaning: good), and then I tried a tiny bit, read to spit it out if it tasted different from the salmon of a ""fresh"" can. As the taste was as it should be, I then ""ventured"" to have two tablespoons of the meat  -  and guess what? No fish or food poisoning; in fact, I ate the whole ""schmeal"" within the next two days with al dente Italian pasta and some grated parmesan cheese. Yum!

This ""best before"" thing is a big marketing trick (I could also say: 'hoax')  to promote sales, as the food manufacturers know how scared people are to eat anything that might not be good anymore.

The expected reaction of the these ""best by"" sensitive consumers is to throw the product into the trash bin and replace it by a new item.

Another example: German canned pumpernickel, the real thing from Westphalia, not what they call pumpernickel in the U.S.  I bought a whole bunch of vacuum sealed cans back in 2002. The expiration year was: 2005. I still have some cans left, and eat -  and fully enjoy  -  the dark coarse slices with butter, camembert or a good fruity jelly.

Thus, if you have canned fish, any fish, ANYTHING that is ""expired"" even for a longer time like two to three years, DO NOT throw it away - do as I did.

This Bumble Bee nonsense is comprised of small floating sections and chunks of salmon, no skin, no bones (the healthiest part of the fish), in two to three inches of brine.

It is the same can with different wrapping and sold for twice the cost in supermarkets but at Whole Foods Stores for $3.29 and Trader Joes for $2.99 year round except three months out of the year. Will never taste the same as the sockeye salmon fresh out of water, not few weeks old that I BBQ with the skin and eat the whole thing with just pitta bread, nothing added just pure salmon skin, meat and juicy oils. That is one real tasty delicious food out of this world. These are not as tasty but it is the best alternative and a very good alternative since ready whenever I want it to, in a can. Forget about the farm raised junk fish where they add carpet die. For something like $3.50 a pound, this is a very healthy protein source for me with many nutrients especially after pumping iron. Costco sells the worst tasting canned pink salmon, these are much better than Costco. Pink salmon is sold in cans hardly ever or infact never fresh unless you catch it yourself in Alaska. These are all small salmons so you will get couple of whole salmons in a can with all the bones and the skin. Product feature description is wrong. You can not take out the skin and the bone that easily so you may forget about buying this salmon if you can not consume it all. There is no vitamin A in this salmon either like some claims out there. I consume a lot of wild fish, sprats, sardines, herrings... No farm raised fish for me or fresh fish unless I catch it myself since fresh fish means few weeks old except shell fish which I get it in three days. The smaller the fish the more nutrition in the fish. I consume these salmon since these salmon stay in the rivers of cold Pacific in order not to be consumed by the bigger fish and feast on small bugs and fish which are high in nutrients. Few of the reviews on Amazon about these salmons consuming squid is misrepresentation. Bones means calcium. Skin means good polyunsaturated fat. I mix the whole can with few different vegetables and wolla, get my calcium, protein and all nutrients for $3.50 a pound. These pink canned salmons are in water not vegetable oil. I drain the water since I could care less for 2000 mg of salt in the can. Healthy, without any additives, growth hormones, pesticides, antibiotics, carpet dye, or sitting on a shelf exposed to air for few weeks... Sockeye salmon is the only fresh wild salmon you can get during the spring run and sold as smoked salmon which I consume but cost more. Atlantic and steelheads are only farm raised. Keta, Pink, Chum, Coho are always canned. Bravo.

It's more expensive, a bit more actually, than the kind I can get in a can at my local grocery store. However we had run out and I was on Amazon one night and we had no plans to go to town any time soon soooo Prime shopping time...LITERALLY Prime shopping time, haha.
The salmon is wild caught, important to us.

This was actually my first time purchasing canned salmon that was deboned and had no skin etc. It was a sort of decadent meal addition to just open the can and dig in, or open the cam and tip out on to our plates.

It's really delicious, I kept nibbling bits as I was preparing our meal. This sort of canned salmon is WONDERFUL for fish tacos. Nom nom.

As I mentioned the only detractor is the price, more expensive than the kind with bone in and still has skin...I know some people just eat the bones but I get squeamish (I'm eating a dead fish you'd think squeamish would be out the window eh?) but anyways I spend a fair amount of time preparing the other sort of salmon, removing the bones etc.
So time wise, this is a MUCH better option.

7304,5,True,1369612800,"I love this salmon, taste just as good as red wild sockeye Alaskan salmon. I cook this in a light Indian curry way and we have it with chapatis.

2 cans salmon
1 red onion sliced
4 whole cloves
I large slice/or chopped tomato
2 cloves garlic sliced/crushed
1/4 hot pepper (optional, but adds the kick to the curry)
1 teaspoon curry powder (your favorite)
2 tablespoon oil
dash of black pepper
* Youll notice that I didn't add any salt, as I find that most canned foods are already loaded with salt. Add as you feel is necessary.

In a saucepan on medium/high heat, heat the oil add the cloves and then add the sliced onion and garlic and cook for a couple minutes on medium heat. Allow to soften and release its natural oils.

Now add the slices of hot pepper and allow to cook for about a minute, then add the curry powder and stir well. Let that cook (stir) cook for about 2 minutes, then add about 5 tablespoons of water and stir to pick up all the curry that may be stuck to the bottom of the pot.

Turn down the heat to low and allow the curry paste to cook for about 3-5 minutes until all the liquid cooks off. Add the tomatoes. The next step is to empty the can of salmon into the pot and break apart (add the liquid from the can as well). Try to keep it in flakes, so theres some texture to the final outcome. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer (covered).

With the lid on, it will spring some of its own juices. Cook this for about 5 minutes or until it thickens a bit. Remember to stir a couple times, but try not to break-up the fish too much.

The smaller the fish the more nutrition in the fish. I purchased Bear and Wolf from Costco and returned it immediately due to its taste and sogginess. Then I started looking around and found the right pink salmons in 15 oz cans with bones and skin.

HERE IS THE GIG ON 15OZ CANS, THESE ARE ONLY 6OZ HALF OF 15OZ: The cannery which produces ALASKA PINK SALMON the 15 oz cans, produces for majority of the sellers of pink salmon including Trader Joe's, Whole Foods and all different brands in grocery stores. The can is the same, just the paper labelling is different with different pricing. Pink salmon is sold in cans majority of times. These are all small salmons so you will get couple of whole salmon in a can with all the bones and skin. You can not take out the skin and the bone that easily so you may forget about buying the 15 oz cans. There is no vitamin A in this salmon either.  I consume these salmon since these salmon stay in the rivers of cold Pacific for first few years in order not to be consumed by the bigger fish and feast on small bugs and fish which are high in nutrients. Bones means calcium. Skin means good polyunsaturated fat. I mix all my fish with many different vegetables since that is my main ingredient for protein. These salmons are in water not vegetable oil. I drain the water since that is where the 2000 mg of salt is lingering around and no need to consume salt. Healthy, without any additives, growth hormones, pesticides, antibiotics, carpet dye, or sitting on a shelf exposed to air for few weeks. Sockeye salmon is the only fresh wild salmon you can get during the spring run and sold as smoked salmon which I consume but cost more. Atlantic and steelhead are only farm raised. Keta, Pink, Chum, Coho are always canned. 99% of all cans are lined in plastic which leach high levels of a chemical called Bisphenol A, which has been linked to cancer, clogging of arteries, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes.

The product is 5 star all the way. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is for the outrageous price here on Amazon.

I originally found this at Costco several months ago. I didn't recall how much I had paid for it when I stumbled upon it again on Amazon. My prevailing thought was, 'with the gas prices, I have to be saving money by purchasing it online'. I could not have been more wrong. I had already purchased two 6x6 sleeves on here when I ended up visiting Costco with my mother-in-law to find that the exact same product was only $9.99. That's half the price. How can Amazon justify doubling the price on the exact same item?! I was fuming. Never again will I buy this on Amazon.

While shopping at my local Costco warehouse store, I discovered  a wrapped set of six six-ounce cans of Bear & Wolf Pink Salmon. It's wild Alaskan salmon, packed with a little water and salt, and it's skinless and boneless.

I opened up a can when I got home. It has very little ""fishy"" odor, although my  cats certainly got excited when the top came off the can, and the taste is fresh and mild. Excellent! One of the reviews suggested eating it raw, so that's what I did with a variety of salad veggies. Mmmmm, good. Nice lunch. I'll surely repeat this. Plus the unused portion in the can was easy to cap and return to the fridge. Another suggestion was to put it in casseroles for baking. Of course, I can hardly wait. A scalloped potato dish with salmon ought to be excellent. Or salmon with noodles. I can even take it along as a quality source of protein when I go camping. That's what I like about this product.

The fish is nice and flaky when you first probe it with a fork, but when I tried to scoop some out to put on a cracker it flaked apart to excess, forcing me to scoop up several forkfuls of broken flesh as opposed to a solid piece of fish.  The problem was that the meat is so dry that it falls apart, and when eaten it's way too dry to enjoy.  I ate about a quarter of the can and could not finish the rest.  Maybe I got a bad can or something, but dry fish isn't my favorite so I could only give these sardines 3 stars.

So from food prep stance they are very convenient.  They come with their bones in and skin on.  The bones make them a valuable source of Calcium, I believe 425 mg per can.  The skin on helps retain their fat.  They are a good source of Omega 3 fat and should have a good Omega 6 to Omega 3 ratio.  Less than 4.
I did not get them with the intent of eating them myself.  However, I tried them and found them quite tasty.  They are good in a salad.  You can easily remove the bones if you wish.
For two humans, two, 65 pound dogs and one cat we use about five cans per week.  The dogs and the cat both like the brine water.  There is zero waste.

7429,2,True,1408924800,"Just as a bit of background, I've purchased every type of sardines in water that amazon sells. Generally the price of the sardines goes along with the quality fairly consistently with a couple exceptions. This is not one of the exceptions, except that being the least costly sardine sold by Amazon in price per ounce, it's still overpriced.

Why two stars? Every now and then one of the tins of sardines is acceptable.

My overall experience, and I waited over a month and a half after the purchase to review, is not a good one.

1. Upon receiving the box, which was left outside by the delivery person (just a fact, not a complaint), I noted it was a fly attractant. Later I found one of the tins had been damaged and partially opened. Nasty experience for sure, smell-wise as well as what all was attracted to it by the time I found the tin that was open.

2. I've never been able to eat a whole tin, just can't stomach them. Even the cats can't go through a whole tin, but every other sardine purchased the cats will eat until the fish are gone. Not these.

3. The consistency is poor. The contents of some tins are really nasty, smelling, looking and tasting.

4. Some tins are only about half full of sardine it would seem, some are nearly full. Looks like each and every tin gets 3 sardines. I think one tin had 3.5 sardines, but it was kind of hard to tell.

So I won't eat these after giving it a fair go and testing several tins over the course of several weeks, but do give them to the cats and frequently take a bite when preparing them for the cats, which I just did again today. As I sit here I'm wondering if I'll need to run to the toilet and puke. Not sure yet but it's not sitting well and only had a really small bite, amazingly the cats seemed to dig into this particular batch.

The household resident His Majesty The Cat (he runs things around here) loves them too.  I noticed one commenter said their cat(s) and/or dogs don't like them.  No wonder - the way people are buying all these pet foods, loaded with all kinds of crap, scientifically taste-engineered to keep the veterinarian industry's money flowing with all the unhealthy animals that are being sugar-coatingly poisoned by their unwary keepers (owners).

The only draw-backs, and they're so miniscule to me they're hardly worth mentioning, and that's the EZ open can isn't all that easily opened unless you want the brine gushing out all over the place.  Also, the brine is rather on the salty side. I don't know where one commenter said these are ""no salt added""; not only can you taste it - it says so on the wrapper-box.  I usually don't eat any canned fish anyways without straining them, letting them soak in some distilled water for a while, and then I take the bones out (no need for all that calcium unless you like it when your eyes feel like they've got sand in them and also caking up your eyelids).

South Korean Shellfish Recalled- Norovirus

Posted on: June 05, 2012 * Author: Laura Hosford-Yunker

On May 18, 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the recall of South Korean Shellfish due to possible Norovirus contamination. The FDA issued an update on May 25 adding more products to the recall.  On June 1, Crown Prince notified all of its wholesalers to suspend shipments and retailers to remove South Korean shellfish from their shelves.
About the Contamination

  Norovirus was found in many of the shellfish tested.
  Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and inflammation of the intestines and stomach.
  Norovirus is highly contagious, but it's not usually life-threatening.
  Consumers should immediately stop eating any of these shellfish and return them to the store where purchased.

7614,5,True,1336521600,"So a few weeks ago I went and bought some Crown Prince smoked oysters, the ones in the red box.  They were horrible, as well as every other brand I have tried.  I came to Amazon to see if there were any good brands and found glowing reviews on this but didn't get them as I wanted to try them before buying them online, especially 9 of them.  I saw them at my local grocery store for $1.75 more than the ones in the red box but I can not express how much better these were.

They're bigger, I'd say around 50-75% bigger.

They are not grainy, the red box ones and every other brand I've tried are very grainy.

No green color to them.  This is probably really scary but all other brands, and the Crown in the red box, have a little green tinge to them.

These are not rubbery.  The texture to these are much much better.

Taste is much better.  I don't know if it is all due to the higher quality or that they are packed in olive oil rather than linseed oil.

I noticed that all other brands and the Crown Oysters in the red box are from China where these are from Korea as other reviews have said.  I think I will be avoiding everything from China from now on just because of these Oysters.  This is how all Smoked Oysters in a can tasted when I was a kid, and I loved them then as I do now.  I know that oysters are never 100% safe to eat but if you want to eat them then these are the ones to get.  I did the subscription thing through Amazon on these, first time doing it, but I'm getting them for as cheap as the ones in the Crown Prince red box are here locally and I'm sure I'll be able to eat 9 cans of them in two months anyway so not a big deal.

Yes, these are more expensive and if I could get them locally I would.

Eating them I came to realize the slow reduction in quality we come to think is how they have always been.  These oysters are the way I remember them as a child.  Wonderful-They are not grainy.

7731,3,True,1418342400,"Ever since discovering Alton Brown's simple but super healthy recipe for ventresca tuna salad recently, it's become a staple meal I've made for myself over and over and over.  (Never tried it?  Google it. You'll love it!)  So I'm starting to really be able to distinguish the nuances of different types of tuna.

I have made this salad with cheap skipjack tuna in water (Trader Joe's version of light chunk), albacore tuna in oil (also from TJ), Ortiz Bonito Del Norte White Tuna In Olive Oil purchased on Amazon, and finally the Tonnino Ventresca in olive oil.

Albacore tuna - driest of the bunch.  I've actually never been a fan of canned albacore due to this reason and have always preferred light chunk.  (Alton Brown does have another tuna recipe that uses albacore and it is good for that one.)

Skipjack (light chunk) - it doesn't have the chunky texture as the other tunas, but it's the cheapest and also has the least amount of mercury since skipjack tuna is considerably smaller than the tunas used for albacore and I imagine the other types.  Since I eat tuna salad so often, I do have to watch out for mercury content so skipjack is usually my go-to tuna for this recipe.  Since it is packed in water rather than oil, I just drain the water and then pour a whole ton of high grade EVOO into the can and mix it in the with the tuna, letting it sit for a few minutes to soak through.  This makes a very big difference in flavor and moisture.  Since skipjack is also the cheapest tuna, it's a win-win.

Ortiz white tuna - this isn't labeled ventresca, so I'm assuming it's not since Ortiz does have another version of tuna that is labeled as such.  But it's still a very expensive tuna and my first foray into high-end canned tuna.  VERY GOOD!  My boyfriend took one bite of his salad containing this tuna and his first words were, ""This is good tuna!""  Now, is it so much better than cheap store-bought tuna to be worth the price?  That's subjective.  I will say it is noticeably better in flavor than albacore tuna.  Maybe around a 40% improvement.  For me, it's something I would be willing to pay for once in a while.

Tonnino ventresca tuna - I just had a salad with this tuna and found it disappointing after hearing all the raves about ventresca tuna.  Had I not known it was ventresca, I think I would have just assumed I was eating regular albacore, except the chunks were larger, more moist, and saltier.  I think it's over-salted.  Not too salty but more salty than a good quality tuna needs to be.  There wasn't much more flavor to me than salt and the usual tuna flavor you'd expect.  If the Ortiz was a 40% improvement over regular canned albacore, the Tonnino is less than 10% and definitely not worth the price to me.  The bulk package was cheaper than the Ortiz, but if I'm going to spend the extra money for high-end ""canned"" tuna, then I'd rather go all out and buy the Ortiz next time instead of this one.

I noticed the Ortiz is from Spain, which is where Alton Brown said most ventresca tuna originates from.  I couldn't find any info on where the Tonnino is from on their website, but the jar says it was canned in Puerto Rico.",Not as Good as Ortiz Tuna from Spain,B004CVDV3Q,Tuna Fish,Tonnino Ventresca Tuna in Olive Oil 6.7 oz.

The only negative I see is the slight-to-moderate saltiness of the product: personally, I crave salt constantly, so this is a non-issue for me.  But those who dislike salt (be it for health reasons or mere taste), these *might* be a little too much salt-wise.

One last point: like all well-packed tuna, you can expect the expiration date of the product to be 1-2 years from the day you receive it, and it is truly fine up to that very date.  But once you open the bottle?  Things are much different.  Guidelines basically suggest that tuna begins spoiling about three days after opening, assuming refrigeration of course.

7761,3,True,1362268800,"I really had high hopes for this tuna and wanted to love it. Great reviews , looked yummy from my computer screen and it's a much better value than my current fav Ortiz.

Knowing that I was going to love this tuna-- good tuna in good olive oil, what's not to love-- I ordered 2 packs of 6 to save on shipping.

It arrived in about 5 days and was well packed.  The bottles were all in tact and each sealed with tamper tape. The expiration date, March of 2014 was a nice surprise-- I could enjoy the tuna at my leisure (some products that you buy at Amazon have expiration dates that are less than 2 mos away).  I was a little disappointed to see that the tuna was much darker that the light tuna that I prefer and much darker than pictured,  but decided to withhold judgement until I tasted it.

Well, I've tasted and I'm judging this tuna to be just okay. In my mind, the olive oil should enhance the flavor of the tuna not smother it. The olive oil used in this tuna is too heavy. The tuna didn't taste strictly of tuna, but of tuna with something added-- and not necessarily in a good way.

The entire time I was sampling the Tonnino tuna, I kept thinking that the olive oil was competing with the taste of the tuna. Also, although I drained it, the meat was unctuous on the tongue which is certainly not a good thing. I didn't finish the portion that I served up to sample. I shared it with my beagles-- they loved it and I think it's good for their coats.

Based on the reviews of this tuna, it has may diehard fans. I cannot be counted among them and will be purchasing my Ortiz again and sticking with it. Ortiz taste as tuna should; flavorful, clean on the palate and like good pure tuna.

Now I've got to come up with a plan to rid myself of the 11 remaining jars of the Tonnino.  My husband would probably make Christian Grey look tame by comparison if he knew I'd spent $80.00 on tuna and couldn't (wouldn't) eat it.

I think I'm going to donate most of it to the local women's shelter-- a lot of people-- again according to the reviews really like this product. The rest, I'm going to give to the beagles.

SIZE= 15oz, majority of fish sold in cans vary in size between 3.5, 6.7, 7.2, 14, 17 ounce
TASTE= From China, very mushy, tomato
MEAT= 440g
MIX= Can not separate fillets from the mix

Fish is my main diet. I try and consume only small fish from reputable sources. No fish from China or Asia, only from Canada, US, Germany and cold Baltic Seas except sardines from Morocco. I am not worried about the added ingredients of tomato sauce, oil, water, etc. since I never consume that part of the can where sodium lingers around plus all additives, I only consume the fish and dump the rest of the mix. I always prefer smoked since the producer has to sell the fish in one piece instead of pieces of fish floating around in juice regardless of the juice type. Fillets are usually sold in some type of tomato juice, water, oil, etc. I never get the chance to taste the real fish which I am after so experience has proven to me to trust smoked more than filet. Filet is always soft and hardly tastes like fish and for that reason always sells less than smoked as well.

My goal is to get the most PROTEIN, CALCIUM and VITAMIN D and B-12 without sacrificing TASTE. No farm raised fish for me, only wild fish. I do not trust what is printed on the Nutrition Facts of the labeling in majority of times since after consuming thousands cans from hundreds of different producers, I have noticed a considerable manipulation of numbers in the NUTRITION FACTS when comparing all those cans time after time. It is obvious to me that there is much misrepresentation especially when it comes to protein on these cans. Canned fish are sold everywhere so prices vary much and Amazon does not have the best prices at all on all since there are many great stores that offer canned fish for unbelievable prices so shoppers need to do their search accordingly. Majority of the canned fish in a flat form shipped by Amazon were shipped to me somehow damaged, bent, cracked open regardless since those cans were not protected properly during shipping due to its weight so remember to have your camera ready.

Smoked sprats from Baltic Seas are the smallest of all only one inch long and I get some 18 sprats in a 4oz cans. Here is the scoop for salmon, herrings and sardines. Sardines, sprat and Alaska salmons offer more calcium since those are complete fish with bones and skin unlike herrings. Herring fillets in mix offer less taste and more additive unlike the smoked herrings which are whole fish with great taste so the extra charge is for the sauce not the fish where I dump anyway so fillets have never made any sense to me. Salmon and sardines offer more protein per calorie but sardines have the most saturated fat per calorie not per serving size. For higher Omega 3 to 6 ratio and vitamin B, I consume Herrings but for high vitamin D and calcium I consume sardines, sprats and Alaskan salmon with bones, skin and all. Check out the comment section of my review for links to other fish with great taste. It is so stupid to purchase farm raised fish which pollute the environment with added carpet dye for coloring before selling it to consumers without any knowledge about farm raised fish practices.

I got into eating sardines because I like the flavor, and also because they're such tiny fish, and so low on the food chain, they're much lower in dioxins and other pollutants than larger fish. (Toxins are accumulated as animals move up the food chain.) I'm accustomed to the sardines in little tins, and had not tried this kind before.

Truth to tell, I'm not really crazy about them. They're about ten times the size of the kind I usually eat. Their size suggests that they are they're higher on the food chain. (""Big fish eat little fish..."")  So some of the health benefits normally associated with sardines would likely not apply. They're not nearly as tasty as tiny Crown Prince sardines in olive oil.

BTW, after a bit of research, I've found that Sardines and Herring can be the same thing! Seems a moderate number of related fish fit either category. One interesting yet not surprising fact is that some companies cut off just the part with the tail and sell them as sardines. Nothing like the middle part IMHO.

My wife and I both like smoked trout and I had never seen smoked sardines, so I thought I would give these a try. I was curious to see if I could find these on Amazon, as a lot of times our local market will carry something for a few months and then they will discontinue an item and move on to something else. Anyway, my wife and I both thought these were wonderful. They have a very nice smoky flavor, not too subtle but not overpowering. I always check out some of the most recent bad reviews before I write a review, to see if I can contribute anything to the conversation. Let me say that you can most definitely tell these are smoked and they are not overly ""fishy"". They are not ""huge"". They are normal sized sardines. We did not find them to be salty.(I never add salt to food and if something is overly salty I am quick to pick up on it.) I would prefer them to be packed in olive oil rather than water, but they are still quite delicious.

The trout in this can has a firm texture. The flesh has a slight reddish (or pinkish) tint, but you can clearly see the rainbow markings on the skin side of the filets. What I especially love is the smoke flavor is natural. Some smoked fish has a chemical taste, but these are as good as if you smoked them yourself. Another thing I love is there are no additives - the contents are only trout, olive oil and sea salt.

Nutritionally the sodium content is somewhat low at only 38mg per can, but the cholesterol is a little on the high side at 80mg. This should not be a problem with any but the strictest diets, though and those numbers are offset by nearly pure protein (about 23 grams). Calories are 173 per can, and fat (from both the trout and olive oil) is 11 grams, 3 of which are from saturated fats.

I didn't give this product 5 stars because the label says it's high in omega 3's but there is no quantification of that on the package -- these are farmed fish, the manufacturer should be able to estimate the average omega 3 fat content per serving. Another reason is because it's not totally boneless and packed in oil, which is kind of messy to drain. The fish fillet is quite small, so the bones are small too and soft from processing, making any hidden bones not a problem for adults to eat.

The company offers canned fish including herring, mackerel, sardines, salmon, and many more. The company was founded in 1949 and is based in Sassnitz, Germany. Rugen is such a giant in herring business that they sell all their herrings through different wholesalers which all you need to do is look at the packaging with only different seller.

MEAT= 170g
MIX= Can separate fillets from the mix

Fish is my main diet. I try and consume only small fish from reputable sources. No fish from China or Asia, only from Canada, US, Germany and cold Baltic Seas except sardines from Morocco. I am not worried about the added ingredients of tomato sauce, oil, water, etc. since I never consume that part of the can where sodium lingers around plus all additives, I only consume the fish and dump the rest of the mix. I always prefer smoked since the producer has to sell the fish in one piece instead of pieces of fish floating around in juice regardless of the juice type. Fillets are usually sold in some type of tomato juice, water, oil, etc. I never get the chance to taste the real fish which I am after so experience has proven to me to trust smoked more than filet. Filet is always soft and hardly tastes like fish and for that reason always sells less than smoked as well.

My goal is to get the most PROTEIN, CALCIUM and VITAMIN D and B-12 without sacrificing TASTE. No farm raised fish for me, only wild fish. I do not trust what is printed on the Nutrition Facts of the labeling in majority of times since after consuming thousands cans from hundreds of different producers, I have noticed a considerable manipulation of numbers in the NUTRITION FACTS when comparing all those cans time after time. It is obvious to me that there is much misrepresentation especially when it comes to protein on these cans. Canned fish are sold everywhere so prices vary much and Amazon does not have the best prices at all on all since there are many great stores that offer canned fish for unbelievable prices so shoppers need to do their search accordingly. Majority of the canned fish in a flat form shipped by Amazon were shipped to me somehow damaged, bent, cracked open regardless since those cans were not protected properly during shipping due to its weight so remember to have your camera ready.

Smoked sprats from Baltic Seas are the smallest of all only one inch long and I get some 18 sprats in a 4oz cans. Here is the scoop for salmon, herrings and sardines. Sardines, sprat and Alaska salmons offer more calcium since those are complete fish with bones and skin unlike herrings. Herring fillets in mix offer less taste and more additive unlike the smoked herrings which are whole fish with great taste so the extra charge is for the sauce not the fish where I dump anyway so fillets have never made any sense to me. Salmon and sardines offer more protein per calorie but sardines have the most saturated fat per calorie not per serving size. For higher Omega 3 to 6 ratio and vitamin B, I consume Herrings but for high vitamin D and calcium I consume sardines, sprats and Alaskan salmon with bones, skin and all. Check out the comment section of my review for links to other fish with great taste. It is so stupid to purchase farm raised fish which pollute the environment with added carpet dye for coloring before selling it to consumers without any knowledge about farm raised fish practices.

Now it is September 2012 and I wanted to get some more of this very tasty fish in mustard sauce - it's the best canned fish I've found, with a long shelf life. High quality product, arrived on time with few-to-little dents. The mustard sauce is great.

The problem here is my order in May cost under $9 (w/ free Prime shipping) for the 9 tins of fish.  The price now is $24 plus added $5 shipping.  No more Prime? No more Subscribe and Save? Come on Amazon, bring this back.  Tripling the price is not fair.

It would be 5 stars for the product alone, but the insane price increase is not acceptable so one star is removed.

EDIT 10/2012-  The price has come down a little bit to $20 with free Prime shipping but it is still nowhere near the original $9 I paid with my first order.  I went ahead and ordered anyway because I can't find this locally at all. This latest shipment had each tin individually wrapped in bubble wrap and there were ZERO dents in the tins.  Thank you Amazon for at least packaging these properly, even if the price is still too high.  It's good fish and the expiration date on this order (received in October 2012) is 12/31/2016.

EDIT 3/2014-  The price has stabilized however Amazon is selling old fish.  The expiration date on this batch was the same 12/31/2016 date on my last TWO orders.  This should have a shelf expiration date of 4+ years so this fish has been sitting around for at least 2 years somewhere.

7994,4,True,1336262400,"Like most herring products, MW Polar Herring Fillets in Mustard is delicious.  However, MW Polar makes the mistake of adding vegetable oil to this product.  I've eaten many cans of sardines in tomato sauce from Thailand and they taste delicious despite the fact that no vegetable oil is added.  The fat from the sardines is more than enough to make the tomato paste delicious.  Herring tastes a little better than sardines even though these 2 fish species look almost exactly alike.  MW Polar should stop adding vegetable oil to their herring products because the fat from the herring is more than enough to make it delicious.
Some scientists are worried, based on experiments with lower animals, that cetoleic acid (an omega-11 fatty acid), which comprises about 10% of herring fat, could be cardiotoxic to humans.  Sardine fat is only about 1% cetoleic acid.  I personally am not worried about eating plenty of the cetoleic acid in herring fat because the Inuit Eskimos of Greenland, who hunt and eat marine mammals in addition to fish, ingest about 100 times the cetoleic acid of most American fish eaters.

(That's saying something since there is a ton of food for this feast!) The salmon is mild and NOT fishy smelling or tasting, beyond what is a healthy amount of fish smell (it is fish, after all). I loved the salmon loaf made from it. And my husband, who has become the official salmon loaf baker since his grandmother became too ill to do so years ago, ended up loving this brand's salmon too.

Cracked open a can and was actually pretty impressed, for canned salmon, this stuff is not bad at all!! I had to stop myself from not eating the whole can in one sitting, lol!

So that night for dinner I made some simple tacos, no taco sauce, but salsa and made one of his with some of this. Surprisingly, he didn't believe me when I told him that it was salmon! He loved it too!

Now I'll be watching for either the price to drop or to see if I can find it in our local grocer stores. Love Subscribe and Save and Prime Pantry but these do seem a bit steep to me. Sustainably caught, product of the USA so I'm sure worth paying a bit more for but I'm still going to shop around a bit to compare.

I rated it 2-stars because maybe this product is for someone but not me. I'll stick to buying tuna instead of trying to be adventurous and by salmon.

Anyways, I'd recommend buying a can in your local store prior to buying 12 cans. Luckily for me, due to loose packaging, I received only 11. This was quickly resolved by Amazon and has no impact on the rating.

In terms of bones, the first can had one or two that I crunched into. Second, had a small piece. Third and fourth, haven't had any.

8206,5,False,1371427200,"One of the reasons this tuna tastes so much better than other brands is that they only cook it once.  Most brands cook their tuna twice which degrades the flavor and the texture.  This olive oil version is my favorite choice for using on a green salad or eating on a cracker.  I even use the oil it's packed in on my salad.  This tuna is delicious!

Wild Planet uses fish caught by ""trolling or pole & line"" which is the recommendation by most non-governmental environmental fishing watch groups including the Monterey Bay Aquarium ""Seafood Watch"".  These fishing methods do not reach as deep in to the water so they catch younger, more tasty, more Omega 3-rich fish & with lower mercury levels.  The bigger, older fish typically swim deeper & because they are older, they have higher mercury levels.

Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood watch has an excellent website, app for your phone & a pocket guide advising on which seafood is safest to eat and sustainable.

8217,4,True,1360627200,"Wild Planet does so many things right:  (1)Other brands of 66.5oz tuna cans will cheat us a little on the quantity of tuna meat but Wild Planet actually gives us a little bit more than the 66.5oz claimed on the tuna can.  (2)Wild Planet gives us a better ratio of solid chunks to flaky mush than smaller tuna cans of most brands.  (3)Wild Planet certifies that their tuna is skipjack tuna and not some other higher-mercury species of ""Chunk Light"" tuna such as various bonitos, kawa kawa, dogtooth tuna (tongol), or yellowfin tuna.  (4)Wild Planet tuna cans are BPA-free.  (5)Wild Planet satisfies the environmentalists, conservationists, and animal rights activists by certifying that their tuna is dolphin-safe, turtle-safe, and sustainable because their tuna is caught one by one by fishing pole instead of lifted up in huge numbers by longline fishing nets.  This has the beneficial side effect of keeping their skipjack tuna fish smaller in size and lower in mercury than the largest skipjack tunas.
HOWEVER, Wild Planet does one thing wrong:  (1)Wild Planet uses ""spring water"" instead of ""vegetable broth,"" which is usually just soybean juice plus onion juice plus carrot juice plus cabbage juice or celery juice or celeriac juice.  The 3 most popular brands of canned tuna added spring water to their tuna in the past [and StarKist brand still adds spring water to their low sodium and very low sodium tuna cans] but these Big 3 tuna brands now add vegetable broth to their canned tuna instead.  Why?  Their stated reason is that vegetable broth is a seasoning that improves the flavor of their tuna.  I'm convinced that the real reason is to prevent the formation of cancer-causing nitrosamines.  [Salted fish products are known to be high in cancer-causing nitrosamines].  The U.S. government has laws that require bacon manufacturers to reduce the amount of nitrosamines in their bacon products and has laws that encourage tuna canners to add vegetable broth instead of spring water to their canned tuna (Please click ""Comment"" below).
Expect to receive your tuna cans severely dented.

8218,5,True,1356480000,"After reading the other reviews stating how much water is in these cans, I was pleasantly surprised by how much meat is actually in the can. The water is actually quite minimal, though it might not look like it at first. After pouring off the water, the can is nearly full with tuna meat. In any case, the net weight is the weight of just the meat itself, so you're getting just over 4 pounds of tuna meat in each can. This is the equivalent of over 13 of the small 5 oz cans.

I can't tell too much difference between the taste of this tuna compared to Starkist/BumbleBee... tuna is tuna to me... but other family members say it does have a slightly different taste, not bad though. I've never had the small cans of this brand either, so I can't comment on any differences there.

8219,1,True,1330905600,"Purchased this because it is was less than 1/2 price of the smaller cans.  It tasted decently, though the other commentors are correct that it tastes very different than the smaller cans - the smaller cans have a much more ""clean"" flavor.  The color of this can's meat is also different (darker, pinker).

But my biggest problem is that there is SO much water in the can.  Really, a lot.  (I think someone else called it ""soupy"", and that is correct).  I cannot help but think this is deliberate, and it disturbs me; it makes me realize that maybe this company is *not* on our side, after all.

So, if you are on the fence, go ahead and get a can.  You won't lose too much, and you can make your own judgement.

Recently, I read about their tremendous health benefits and have wanted to cut back on meat.  Fresh fish in the market is so expensive and has so much mercury in the wild versions and don't get me started on the farm raised varieties. Anyway, the smaller the fish, the lower the levels of mercury. I bought the Wild Planet brand and rinse them in cold water. I don't need all the oil and I think it gives them a much fresher taste. The slightly smokey flavour is delicious. I highly recommend them.

I don't know where Shebear ""Shebear"" gets their information about the source of the sardines. The Wild Planet website specifically says that they are caught off the California coastline. I grew up in the Monterey Cannery Row area. The sardines were a thriving industry at one time but then they were gone. These are the return of the Pacific Coast sardines.

Edit: found this FAQ on the wild Planet site. I am impressed with the transparency of this company. The sardines are truly caught in US Pacific waters, however, they are processed in Vietnam. Here is their statement:
Why are Wild Planet tuna and sardines caught in the US but packed in Vietnam?

Unfortunately, there is no US sardine or tuna cannery capable of processing our volume requirements and the last sardine factory in the United States closed in 2010. In addition, the US cost of production would greatly increase the retail price beyond the reach of most families. Our goal is to make US-sourced sustainable seafood choices mainstream and thus have a greater impact on fishery harvest practices for the long-term good of ocean conservation.

We have elected to process our 5oz cans of albacore and skipjack tuna as well as our sardines in a highly respected partner facility in Vietnam. This facility offers state-of-the-art canning expertise in an immaculately clean, accredited environment that produces higher quality finished products than any cannery we have seen in the US.

So I was eager to try their Wild Sardines in Extra Virgin Olive Oil. There were 4 plump, scaled, and cleaned sardines in the tin I got. Typically, there are 3 sardines in a tin of this size, so I don't know if I just lucked out or what. The texture is excellent, as I find with all Wild Planet Sardines. The fish are moist all the way through but still firm. I don't bother to remove the bones. They're quite soft. I only occasionally notice them while eating. These sardines are lightly smoked, as it says in the third line underneath the title on the package. This should probably be stated more prominently to avoid confusion.

These have a deeper smoked flavor than I would prefer for everyday consumption. It sometimes has a subtle burnt quality. I prefer the flavor of Bela's Lightly Smoked Sardines in Olive Oil, which are also plump and moist, but those are not scaled. There is some trade-off there, because the anti-corrosion coating in Wild Planet's tins does not contain BPA, one of the reasons that I generally avoid canned foods. And their sardines have been rated as the Best Choice for Sustainability by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Program. The quality and texture of the sardines is excellent.

Having embarked on an sardine tasting journey over the past few years has made me realize some are better than others, and these are just fair. The oil to sardine ratio is high, like they are swimming in the oil. The black backs are the first thing you see when you open the can, as one reviewer put it they look like eels. The can is not a winner either, most of the time when opening oil sloshes out onto whatever surface the can is on. This does not happen with standard type cans. The taste is pretty bland. The best thing about these is they have good marketing. Wild caught! Sustainable! I'm not sure of any sardine type fish that aren't wild caught.

To me part of the joy of opening a can of good sardines is how they look laying in the can. Single or double layer? Are they the same size? Are the skins perfect or damaged? If smoked do they have that beautiful gold tinge? Are there obvious scales? If augmented with lemon peels or red or green peppers how do they look?

Taste and texture is next. Do they taste like tuna or sardines? Or something else? I'm hoping sardines. Are they moist and a joy to eat or mushy or dry and nasty? How is the aftertaste?

For what I would rate as excellent sardines/sprats/brislings try the smoked ones from Latvia (Adro Riga Smoked Sprats, 5.6-Ounce, round can) and Germany (Ruegen Smoked Kieler Sprats, 3.88 Ounce, German precision in a can).","There are so many better sardines out there, don't waste your money or time with these.",B004VDH4L0,Sardines,"Wild Planet, Wild Sardines in Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 4.4 Ounce (Pack of 6)",-0.99494106,1

While there is some sticker shock ($16 for 6 cans), you will certainly fell full and satisfied after eating a tin of these with some brown rice and steamed broccoli.  There's only room for 3 hefty-sized sardines and the tin opens very easily (compared to Crown Prince).  The can is indeed filled to the brim with a watery extra virgin olive oil mix.  (EVOO is the healthiest option when evaluating sardine 'flavors' like sunflower, soybean, mustard, etc...).  Now, when I think of EVOO, I think of the strong taste and its thickness.  These sardines feel like they're bathing in a watery olive oil mix (more on the watery side) - so if you're expecting an oil slick, this isn't it.  I pour out a bit of the ""solution"" out and then eat the rest.  The sardines have a pleasant, light smoky taste to it that doesn't overwhelm your palette and so far, there's not been any horrific experience with scales.  Did I mention that there's no strong fishy aftertaste?  (something, I've come to expect with the Crown Prince tomato sardines?)

What I like about Wild Planet is that their cans are BPA free (material used in the containers, which, when broken down, can leech onto the food -- BPA has strong links to cancer).  Not all brands have committed to this, or if they have, it's only in specific sardine products.

I used one piece out of the can on a sandwich of sliced avocado and toasted Ezekiel bread and put the rest in the fridge.  I am seriously considering dumping the remainder in the trash.  There aren't many words that capture just how crappy these are.

I bought these against my better judgement (based on reviews I've seen here and elsewhere).  The packaging says ""sustainably caught in the Pacific Ocean"" but, when you read the fine print, it says ""processed in Vietnam.""  How sustainable can it be to ship something halfway around the world for processing!?  I am a seasoned consumer of canned sardines, and I usually read the label and scan for the phrases ""Product of Portugal"" or ""Product of Morocco"" when trying a brand I've never had before.  These are my trusted sources for good sardines, but in this case, I fell for the ""environmentally conscious"" marketing ploy.  Big mistake. The packaging also says ""lightly smoked.""  This is also misleading.  Upon tasting, the smoke has that fake ""smoke flavoring added"" taste to it.  Hard to explain, but it just doesn't taste right.

I actually keep a folder on my PC titled Sardine Tasting Notes.  If I try a brand that is particularly memorable (either very good or very bad), I make a little notepad file and store it in that folder.

Cons: Where is the flavor? I have tasted various canned sardines. I can occasionally tell the differing flavor characteristics that each brand seems to have. Some taste very smokey. Others seem to take in the taste of the olive oil they are packed in. One brand I noticed had a lemony aftertaste. I actually prefer strong tasting fish but I can find that I appreciate each brand and really haven't found one I wouldn't buy again.  Until now. I wouldn't mark in in the dislike column. More towards the didn't really prefer. After a brief almost non-existent smoke taste, the fish itself is flavorless. It is also dry. The olive oil seemed to impart no flavor or moisture to this product. I had to pile on the hot sauce to get through the first two cans (I usually plop one can over rice as a quick snack). Plus this product was processed in Vietnam.

8336,5,True,1520035200,"The flavor and versatility of these anchovies is incredible.

For starters, these are not for eating right out of the can; they need a bit of a wash and soak to control the intense saltiness.  Personally, if I'm going to be eating them alone or on tapas, I prefer to clean and debone them.  Some people like the crunch of the little bones, so you should least give it a try to see if that's your thing.

Here is how I prepare them:
1) Open can and transfer all sardines out to a glass long-term storage container, lining container with salt & reusing as much salt from the can as possible.
2) Take sardines out of container, put them in a little bowl, and gently run water over them for a minute or so.  Then let them soak in water for 5-10 minutes.
3) Dump the water and then add half-water/half-white-vinegar and let them sit for about 5 more minutes... although sometimes I do skip this step.
-) This is the point where I will use them for things like salad dressing, or in other recipes where they get smashed up
4) Get a small cutting board and carefully run knife up belly and down back and remove tail.  Pull filet off one side, and scrape out entrails.  Carefully remove backbone (I usually start from the tail as that starts a bit easier) and pull out any left-behind bones.  This process takes me about 60 seconds per sardine.
-) I love eating them here in tapas, but some think they are too salty so I generally do the next step
5) Pack them in a nice olive-oil and let rest for a few days or longer (up to weeks or more, although mine never last that long)
6) Serve up on crostini, with pickled peppers, with olives, with capers, or anything else you want.

This is why I give Kirkland Tuna a 5-star rating, however, there have been times when the cans arrived dented in a way that they cannot be opened due to poor protection from shipping which could always happen to any canned product. I've included photos of such damages showing bad damage to the top of a can and the bottom of another. What I don't understand is why when this item is nicely shrink wrapped as they are it is so hard to protect them from this type of damage. It would seem proper packing materials would make a big difference and I'd suggest using paper instead of plastic pillows in the future which tend to pop easily under the weight of heavier products.

Starkist, Chicken of the sea have both become little more than canned swill from the processing plant floors and counters. I used to love tuna but over the years even the so called solid white, chunk light etc, are little more than third rate offscouring while the quality parts of the fish are sold overseas or to expensive restaurants. But now I tried Kirkland. This is tuna the way I remember it. Solid, light to white, with a slight pinkish hue and a really great taste that reminds me of the aforementioned companies products decades ago when I was a child.

I tried to contact that company, but could not find a number to call. I am very disappointed.. I had hoped to buy more of their canned salmon and am even considering taking another chance by trying one more time. Perhaps it was a bad batch?? Btw, I did resolve the issue with colloidal silver.

This sardine can is said to be ""4.25-Ounce Cans"".  But you either have to include the water or the can itself to get to 4.25oz.  In my measurement, the sardines, after being drained, are only 3oz.

So you must take this into account when calculating total price.

I choose the cans in water.  Don't like flavors, spice or in olive oil, which either distort the original flavor or introduce unnecessary supplements (like not the best olive oil) that I don't want to have.

I also found it easier to empty the can into a bowl and chop the sardines up into a mixture that I could then spread over the mustard/mayo blend.

 - I was a bit concerned purchasing these via the internet since items can get dinged during transit (or be already dented & shipped out) - and horror stories & a wild imagination about the potential side effects of botulism make me ultra careful about checking the containers of any canned food before purchasing.  This pack of 12 arrived in a sturdy, double-walled custom cardboard box that fit the sardines snugly.  Think baseball card box hwere you lift on one side of the top and it opens across.  All sardines arrived in their individual cardboard boxes and none of them were dented/opened and were all clean.  Mega props to Crown Prince & Amazon Fulfillment.

Taste & Fish Quality
- For very little calories, you get 50% of your calcium and protein intake by eating a single can of these things.  And for the price I paid for these (which was like $14 and therefore less than $1.15 / can), this was a real bargain.  There's about 3 or 4 fish packed in these tins - they're fatter than the tiny brislings you often see in King Oscar sardines.  So these are going to be meatier and are great to mix with some chopped red onions (grilled in some extra virgin olive oil), pepper flakes, ground pepper, and served with some steamed veg and brown rice.  Great value, very filling, and tasty.  Note, there is a strong fishy aftertaste. While unpleasant after an hour, this can easily be remedied by eating a slice of tangerine/orange  (if you're not in a place where you can brush your teeth right away).

1 star off for 2 things:
The product was sold and fulfilled by Amazon - it took over 10 days to process and ship-out the order.  No info could be had with the tracking # provided.

I'm a fully functional adult with average muscles - I found these tins to be especially difficult to open up.  It's like the perforations weren't done deep enough into the metal because it took a lot of strength to roll back the top off even half-way through.  This is something to consider if you're older and are looking for something easy to open up. I've eaten a number of different brands of sardines and these are probably the most difficult to open up, in my opinion.  We've eaten through 8 of these tins, and each them were extremely difficult to pry open.  You do have a fear of possibly slicing your fingers as you use all your muscles to pull the tab back.

However, the positive tradeoffs should be considered before ruling out this kind.

The product comes in a large can and the fish are salt packed. Anchovies are an acquired taste but I love them. I use them to flavor many dishes and I have even discovered a wonderful cold salad with shaved onions and capers. These are not the oily fillets that most of us see in our supermarts. These are the whole fish headless and tightly packed in layers of salt. I have found that the best way to clean them is by hand. Soak a few of the fish (I use about three at a time) in cold water and rinse the salt from them. You need to decide how long to soak them by testing how pliable they become. When they are soft enough, remove the fins, split and peal the fish into fillets by hand. If the fish are ready to be split they will do so easily. If you cannot split them by hand keep soaking them. Each fish yields two to three meaty fillets. Once I have removed one side I peal out the tail and spine in one piece. Anyone whose ever cleaned a trout will know the drill ... same process except in miniature. The flavor is exceptional they are not as salty as canned or jarred fillets.

I was shocked when I opened the can and found a thick stew of disintegrating anchovies.  I thought there would be a little liquid amongst plump and firm fish and salt.  Definitely disappointed after reading how many others had good experiences. (1-star)

New review:
I ordered a second can of these anchovies and the difference could not be more obvious from the second I opened the can.  The anchovies inside the second can were large, intact, and very meaty.  There was absolutely NONE of the disintegration and liquidy mess I experienced with the first can.  I can't explain the difference, but two things I noticed: the expiration date on the second can was September 2016, and the first can was May 2016.  Since I was well within the date on both cans there should not have been a spoilage problem but there may have been a difference in the fish themselves based on the time of year they were caught.  Also, the first can had some noticeable dents in it, but the contents were not under pressure like you would expect if they had become spoiled.  The second can was pristine.

They were pretty small and sort of a problem to clean because you didn't end up with much.  This time I bought one can and the anchovies are much larger.  Still I'm doing the same thing I did then-- taking off the tiny heads and tails and using the rest.  Just don't notice the cartilage or whatever especially if they are cooked.  And not sayin' I recommend it-- just what I do.

These are packed in salt so by necessity you're buying a whole lot of salt-- I'd say at least to a third of the can.  Still I'm satisfied.

One benefit-- last time I was eating these anchovies my cholesterol was at a record low.  (Overall number was under 140).  Never been as low since so I'm trying them again.  Because of mercury and the unsustainable harvest of larger fish I'm mostly anchovies, sardines and some pacific salmon.  And these anchovies, well they're strong but a nice change of pace.  I Make the anchovy-caesar dressing and eat more salad and raw veggies.  Throw them into rice dishes, sauces also lightly sauteed with garlic and olive oil and on top of potatoes and so on.  Again, not recommending this but I threw two of these anchovies (after rinsing) right out of the can into a rice dish I was making-- threw them in whole with heads and tails on.

To repack them, once you open the can you will want to remove them and repack them in a glass or ceramic container and keep them in your refrigerator.

Some reviewer mentioned the bones. I have found many bones -- no two tins are created equal by the way -- but those tiny things are fully edible. I'm not sure what kind of bones the other person who said they got stuck in his/her throat found but I can hardly believe an anchovy fillet would have that. For a whole anchovy, I would, of course, remove the spine but for fillets? I have not seen anything that could be a hazard. In fact, I'm not quite sure how you would remove them, even if you wanted to; they are uber small and would probably require you to use a magnifying glass and tweezers. Or maybe the best bet would be to get anchovy paste?

But back to the product, I am 100% satisfied with this brand and plan to reorder more soon.

9341,5,True,1467676800,"Two ounces of flat anchovy fillets in olive oil, and I always keep a few cans on-hand. The tin appears to be approximately two-thirds full of fish and the rest is oil. The fillets are separate and distinct, but as always, thin and somewhat fragile, so I used a fork to separate them for use on a pizza.

The information on the nutritional label states there are approximately 15 fillets per can, which is almost exactly what was in the can I received. The flavor is excellent and the fillets are not mushy. There are two and a half servings per can. Calories are low, 40 calories per serving and for such a small quantity, four grams of protein is impressive, but of course sodium is crazy high at 970mg so they should be used in moderation.

What is so wonderful about anchovies is that their flavor is so intense, even a small amount has an impact  like in salads or eggplant/tomato relishes, etc. My mother only made cheese or anchovy pizzas so I am accustomed to their use and this is a product I regularly buy. This brand is one I have purchased for many years and so far have not encountered any problem.

9350,5,True,1456272000,"We use anchovies on a regular basis. There was a grocery store that regularly carried them cheaply, but they no longer do so, causing us to check out Amazon. This Crown Prince anchovy brand is our favorite so far as they are always full of flavor. We use them chopped up in some things, like salads and also let them melt into sauces and whatnot.

I originally thought I HATED anchovies. The truth was that I had never tried them and just bought into the negative propaganda. When my SO got anchovies on part of the pizza, I thought he was insane. I was wrong, anchovies can actually save a mediocre pizza. But the usefulness of anchovies goes way beyond pizza. I feel kinda dumb that I didn't eat something for years based on other people's tastes, especially since I'm generally willing and eager to try new foods. Anchovies need a positive PR campaign stat. Puttanesca sauce is my absolute favorite thing that uses anchovies and next best is this Cajun Caesar salad my SO makes.

Anchovies are actually pretty good for you since they're high in calcium, potassium and good fatty acids. Eating them can help with cholesterol levels by reducing the bad stuff that can clog your arteries. They can also help make your bones stronger. They're good for dieters (if you can eat fish) because they're high in protein,which makes you feel full. Plus they're low in calories.

Using Subscribe and Save for this has been a good option for us because we don't have to either go hunting for them or try to remember if we've already got a can at home. Having a bunch around has also caused us to up our intake some, which I'm sure my cholesterol levels will no doubt appreciate.

9668,5,False,1398988800,"Morocco is the sardine capital of the world. Other catches other than the Sardines caught by Morocco which is a pilchard sardine, is not considered as Sardine in Europe. Morocco is the largest canned sardine exporter in the world.

PRICE= 3.0, LaSarina 15oz is what I purchase all the time but for small cans in water, these are the best priced
SIZE= 4.25oz, majority of fish sold in cans vary in size between 3.5, 6.7, 7.2, 14, 17 ounce
TASTE= The best Crown Prince sardines. Firm solid sardines with skin and all, the whole thing for complete protein
MEAT= 120g
MIX= Can separate whole fish from the mix since it is water. I consume these straight out of the can since I never consume tomato sauce or oil which come with any of the cans. I always dump the mix since that is where the sodium and additives are. This is pure water, the cleanest ingredients in smallest cans when I am on my sport expeditions.

Fish is my main diet. I try and consume only small fish from reputable sources. No fish from China or Asia, only from Canada, US, Germany and cold Baltic Seas except sardines from Morocco. I am not worried about the added ingredients of tomato sauce, oil, water, etc. since I never consume that part of the can where sodium lingers around plus all additives, I only consume the fish and dump the rest of the mix. I always prefer smoked since the producer has to sell the fish in one piece instead of pieces of fish floating around in juice regardless of the juice type. Fillets are usually sold in some type of tomato juice, water, oil, etc. I never get the chance to taste the real fish which I am after so experience has proven to me to trust smoked more than filet. Filet is always soft and hardly tastes like fish and for that reason always sells less than smoked as well.

My goal is to get the most PROTEIN, CALCIUM and VITAMIN D and B-12 without sacrificing TASTE. No farm raised fish for me, only wild fish. I do not trust what is printed on the Nutrition Facts of the labeling in majority of times since after consuming thousands cans from hundreds of different producers, I have noticed a considerable manipulation of numbers in the NUTRITION FACTS when comparing all those cans time after time. It is obvious to me that there is much misrepresentation especially when it comes to protein on these cans. Canned fish are sold everywhere so prices vary much and Amazon does not have the best prices at all on all since there are many great stores that offer canned fish for unbelievable prices so shoppers need to do their search accordingly. Majority of the canned fish in a flat form shipped by Amazon were shipped to me somehow damaged, bent, cracked open regardless since those cans were not protected properly during shipping due to its weight so remember to have your camera ready.

Smoked sprats from Baltic Seas are the smallest of all only one inch long and I get some 18 sprats in a 4oz cans. Here is the scoop for salmon, herrings and sardines. Sardines, sprat and Alaska salmons offer more calcium since those are complete fish with bones and skin unlike herrings. Herring fillets in mix offer less taste and more additive unlike the smoked herrings which are whole fish with great taste so the extra charge is for the sauce not the fish where I dump anyway so fillets have never made any sense to me. Salmon and sardines offer more protein per calorie but sardines have the most saturated fat per calorie not per serving size. For higher Omega 3 to 6 ratio and vitamin B, I consume Herrings but for high vitamin D and calcium I consume sardines, sprats and Alaskan salmon with bones, skin and all. Check out the comment section of my review for links to other fish with great taste. It is so stupid to purchase farm raised fish which pollute the environment with added carpet dye for coloring before selling it to consumers without any knowledge about farm raised fish practices.

Unlike other brands, these are not available in different oyster sizes in different cans. However, unlike the other brands, every oyster in these cans is in perfect shape, obviously not torn up or rough looking like Reeces or Bumble Bee, etc. Most of the oysters are what the other brands would sell as ""medium"", with the occasional large or small oyster, but never tiny or baby. They are also a bit more heavily smoked than others, or maybe just with a stronger-flavored wood.

I should have noticed the cans (and item description) said 3 oz, but it didn't seem logical that Crown Prince would sell these oysters in a can smaller than their cottonseed packed product...it's only a 20 calorie difference between the two products, so it doesn't appear that it was done for the benefit of the consumer.

10014,5,False,1417910400,"I absolutely love smoked oysters and have been searching far and wide to find that one most delicious can I had several years ago, but cannot remember the name of. These are not it, but they are still quite tasty nonetheless. I ate them straight out of the can.

They are harvested in South Korea from sustainable fisheries (95% of oysters are farmed), lightly smoked over oak, and lightly salted. I like that they are low sodium (150g) so individual people can add more salt or eat as is. I prefer a little more saltiness and sprinkled some coarse sea salt over them.

Texture and mouth-feel are both good-- slightly soft and slightly chewy. I felt the oysters were a bit on the small side though, about the size of an adult thumb up to the first joint. If they were smokier and bigger, with more chewiness, I'd rate them 5 stars, but this is all a matter of personal taste.

You can save yourself a little bit of money by getting them at Trader Joe's for $2.69 a can. I'll post pictures next time to show size and texture. They were so good I forgot to make a video review!

10067,3,True,1437091200,"I would think of this more as a good canned salmon, rather than smoked salmon. Maybe I was spoiled growing up, but I have a pretty firm vision of what smoked salmon should taste like, its texture, moisture, etc. This isn't anything like that. It's dry because they cook it in the container, like canned salmon or tuna, and it doesn't have that soft, flaky texture that fresh smoked salmon has.

Everyone can get mediocre smoked salmon in their grocery store now, so this stuff would be most useful when camping away from civilization. The vacuum pack is nice, but they do surround it with an additional two layers of large and unnecessary packaging, along with some inserts with marketing propaganda. This is another frustration, as a Pacific NW company should be a little more aware of its footprint and the desires of its main demographics. Many of us care if there's that much waste for such a tiny piece of fish.

If you choose to remove the shell near the tail, be sure to check for left over vein and clean that if you find some residual darkness there. This area is usually skipped while eating by many, but personally I use the entire shrimp and noticed this on some. It's not a deal breaker, nor failure in preparation, but it's only wise to always check for missed deveining with all shrimp.

10134,5,True,1398211200,"This is probably the optimal way to buy wild anchovy fillets. The jar is 3.5 ounces and has plenty of fillets in it. It is narrow and tall so it is easy to cover left over fillets with olive or neutral vegetable oil like Mazola. If you do not do this, the fillets will darken on the top and will not be as aesthetically pleasing. There are a few meat juices on the bottom of the jar also but are usable once the jar is empty - as is the left over oil.
What these fillets are are natural free swimming ocean schooling fish that are caught and hand cleaned, filleted, and packed. They have no fancy chemical ingredients and are not raised in ponds in China (and not from China).
They offer a salty delicate flavor to whatever dish they are used in and the usual intent in not to make the dish ""fishy"". When I use anchovies or salty cheeses, I never add salt until the end to make sure I don't over-salt the dish. By using anchovies, I get both salt and flavor in the one ingredient.
Do NOT leave anchovies out of a dish and then decide that the dish is BLAND. When called for, even in small quantities, it is such an important ingredient to most recipes that the dish is changed with its omission. As said, in most cases, the presence of them will be unknown except to the most sophisticated of palates - maybe Bobby Flay.
One of my favorite ""quick fix"" dish is Pasta Puttanesca. I would never dream of leaving out the anchovies. It is as integral ingredient as the capers, olives, and pine nuts.
With respect to the leftover jar juices, use in salad dressing, pizza sauce, flat bread topping, with vegetables or potatoes, with other fish dishes, etc. Google ""anchovy recipes"" and you will be truly surprised at all the uses you will find - and enjoy if you open your culinary mind to new things.

10138,5,False,1385337600,"Two things: (1) I purchase this locally so my review is going to focus on the smoked trout and not address price of shipping costs. (2) When reading my comments about nutrition factor in that nearly all canned fish have high sodium and all that are packed in oil are high in fat. That is the nature of the product.

The reason I gave this five stars is the flavor is absolutely delicious and the texture of the trout indicates that it is of the highest quality.

One thing that I love is the 'smoked' flavor is natural. Some smoked fish taste as though they were dipped in a chemical. This product tastes like cold smoked fish should.

Another thing I love is the pieces have been deboned. There is skin on one side, which is easy to remove if you prefer completely skinless, but is also delicious to those of us who prefer it on the fish.

The nutritional red flags are high fat, sodium and cholesterol. A can is 260 calories of which 140 are from the 16 grams of fat. Sodium is 600mg, which is pretty high if you have restrictions. Cholesterol comes in at 90mg per can.

On the plus side there is a whopping 28 grams of protein per can, so this makes for a protein rich snack or light lunch. In fact, the nutritional gotchas can be be offset if you enjoy a can with a simple salad.

international store (for much less). Having some experience with canned Sprats from Latvia I
would like to share some of the experience and give my take on this product for those who are
contemplating to purchase and consume it.

1) They do not specify what oil they are using. From my experience the oil is not high quality. In fact I would say it is pretty bad.
2) BALTIC WATERS ARE EXTREMELY POLLUTED (Google this ""Baltic waters pollution"") so I would be very careful eating anything coming from there.
3) They do not provide any nutritional information (calories, sodium, fat etc.).
4) The can is not made from a material of acceptable quality. Actually I am not sure if the tin is food grade.
5) The sprats are smoked which is not particularly good for anyone consuming them on a regular basis. They are extremely soft and mushy so that there is no need to chew them; the fish are all soaked in some thick yellow oil and smell and taste smoky almost like low quality cat food (I would never feed them to my cat, however).
6) I never saw an expiration date on the tin cans. I never buy anything without an explicit expiration date especially when fish is in question!

The Sea Best Shrimp arrived frozen rock hard in a mini styrofoam cooler with dry ice. We were amazed when we cooked them a week later, not only with their fresh caught flavor and texture, but how easy they were to prepare. I agree with many seafood experts that cooking shrimp in the shell enhances their flavor and keeps them from getting ragged. The deterrent to that cooking method is the hassle of deveining and peeling while the shrimp are still warm. Since the Sea Best EZ Peel Shrimp already have their shells split and come deveined, post cooking prep for the table is a breeze. It's like unzipping their shell jacket and easily slipping it off.
We were so pleased with this product that we plan to keep at least one pack in the freezer for a quick dinner, or should company drop by and we want to give them an unexpected, and delicious snack alternative to cheese and crackers, or chips and salsa.
